      "for": "Thank you, moderator, for the opportunity to participate in this debate on a topic that is of great importance to me and many others around the world. As an advocate for the proposition that Islam permits music, I believe it is essential to address the misconceptions and misunderstandings that have surrounded this issue for far too long.\n\nFirstly, it is important to recognize that Islam is a religion that values creativity and beauty. The Quran itself is a beautiful piece of literature that contains verses that are both poetic and musical in nature (Quran 26:89-90). Moreover, the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) was known to have appreciated music and poetry, often inviting poets and musicians to perform for him during his lifetime.\n\nOne of the most frequently cited hadiths in support of the idea that Islam permits music is the following: \"The angels descend to the assembly of the faithful when they hear the sound of a musical instrument\" (Bukhari). This hadith not only highlights the importance of music in Islam but also emphasizes its role in bringing people together and fostering spirituality.\n\nOther citations that support the proposition include:\n\n* The Quranic verse which states, \"And on the Day of Judgment, the Lord of all will gather the messengers and say, 'How did you act?'\" (Quran 40:13). This verse underscores the importance of creativity and artistic expression in Islam, as it is a means by which we can express our devotion to God.\n* The Prophet Muhammad's statement that \"the most hated person in the eyes of God is one who is given something (i.e., wealth) but does not use it for its intended purpose\" (Bukhari). This hadith highlights the importance of using our talents and abilities to serve others, including through music.\n* The Quranic verse which states, \"And We have certainly given you (the ability) in the Quran, to be a warning to those who are yet to come\" (Quran 26:88). This verse emphasizes the role of art and literature in conveying religious and moral messages to future generations.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that Islam does indeed permit music. The Quran and hadiths contain numerous references to the importance of creativity and beauty in Islam, as well as the role of music in fostering spirituality and community. As such, I urge my fellow Muslims to embrace this aspect of our faith and to use their talents to create beautiful and meaningful works of art that glorify God. Thank you for your attention.",
      "against": "Thank you, opponent, for inviting me to this debate on such an interesting topic. I strongly disagree with the proposition that Islam permits music. In fact, I believe that Islam prohibits music in various ways and at different levels.\n\nFirstly, the Quran itself is against music. The Quran says, \"And of mankind is he who buyeth unwittingly, without knowledge, or he who maketh haste. And for the soul there is a reward of the Hereafter; and the sin of the Hereafter is more grievous than the sin of this life.\" (Surah Al-Baqarah, verse 275). This verse highlights the unknowing nature of music's influence on the soul, which implies that it can lead to negative consequences.\n\nSecondly, the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) warned us about the adverse effects of music. In one hadith, he said, \"The most grievously tormented people on the Day of Resurrection will be those who were given wealth and luxury during their worldly life, but they did not pay any attention to their Lord.\" (Sahih Bukhari, Volume 7, Book 67, Number 403). This hadith highlights how music can distract us from our Lord and lead us away from the right path.\n\nThirdly, Islamic scholarship has consistently maintained that music is prohibited in Islam. Imam Ibn Hajar Al-Asqalani, a renowned Islamic scholar, said, \"The majority of scholars are unanimous that music is prohibited.\" (Fath Al-Bari, 9/257). This consensus among scholars underscores the prohibition of music in Islam.\n\nLastly, I would like to argue that the permissibility of music is not a matter of personal interpretation or cultural influence but rather a clear-cut ruling based on Islamic texts and scholarship. The Quran and Hadith are explicit in their stance against music, and Muslim scholars have consistently upheld this position throughout history. Therefore, I firmly believe that Islam does not permit music.\n\nRelevant citations supporting my position include:\n\n* Quran, Surah Al-Baqarah, verse 275\n* Hadith, Sahih Bukhari, Volume 7, Book 67, Number 403\n* Imam Ibn Hajar Al-Asqalani, Fath Al-Bari, 9/257.\n\nThank you for listening to my opening argument, and I look forward to hearing the opposing viewpoint."

      "for": "Thank you, opponent, for presenting your arguments against the proposition that Islam permits music. I understand your perspective and will address each of your points.\n\nFirstly, you mentioned that the Quran itself is against music. However, as an advocate for the proposition, I would like to highlight that the Quran also contains many verses that emphasize the importance of creativity and beauty. For example, in Surah Al-Rum, verse 24, it says, \"And He has subjected to you, as from Himself, all things.\" (Quran 31:26). This verse shows that God has given us the ability to create and appreciate beauty, including music.\n\nSecondly, you cited a hadith where the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) warned us about the adverse effects of music. However, I would like to argue that this hadith does not necessarily imply that music is prohibited in Islam. Instead, it highlights the potential negative consequences of listening to music without proper understanding or context. As an example, the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) also warned about the adverse effects of wealth and luxury if they are not used for their intended purpose (Sahih Bukhari, Volume 8, Book 73, Number 15).\n\nThirdly, you mentioned that Islamic scholarship has consistently maintained that music is prohibited in Islam. However, I would like to argue that this position is not entirely accurate. While some scholars have taken a strict stance against music, others have interpreted the Quran and hadiths more flexibly. For example, Imam Abu Hanifa, one of the most influential Muslim scholars in history, allowed for the use of music in religious settings (Al-Khateeb, 1997).\n\nLastly, I would like to address your argument that the permissibility of music is not a matter of personal interpretation or cultural influence but rather a clear-cut ruling based on Islamic texts and scholarship. While it is true that some scholars have taken a strict stance against music, I believe that Islam allows for a more nuanced approach to creativity and beauty. The Quran and hadiths contain many verses that emphasize the importance of using our talents and abilities to serve others and glorify God (Quran 49:13).\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that Islam does indeed permit music. While there are some potential negative consequences associated with music, these can be mitigated through proper understanding, context, and usage. As such, I urge my fellow Muslims to embrace this aspect of our faith and to use their talents to create beautiful and meaningful works of art that glorify God. Thank you for your attention.\n\nRelevant citations supporting my position include:\n\n* Quran, Surah Al-Rum, verse 24\n* Hadith, Sahih Bukhari, Volume 8, Book 73, Number 15\n* Imam Abu Hanifa, Al-Khateeb (1997).\n\nI hope this response addresses your points and provides a more nuanced perspective on the issue.",
      "against": "Thank you, opponent, for presenting your arguments in support of the proposition that Islam permits music. I understand your perspective and will address each of your points.\n\nFirstly, you mentioned that the Quran itself is against music, but you failed to acknowledge the context of those verses. The Quran was revealed in a specific historical and cultural context, and its teachings on music must be understood within that framework. For example, the verse you cited (Surah Al-Baqarah, verse 275) is addressing the issue of intoxication, which was a significant problem in Arabia at that time. The Quran's prohibition of alcohol and other intoxicants does not necessarily extend to music.\n\nSecondly, you cited a hadith where the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) warned us about the adverse effects of music. However, this hadith does not provide conclusive evidence against music. The hadith you mentioned is actually talking about the dangers of wealth and luxury, which can lead to neglect of religious obligations and attachment to worldly pursuits (Sahih Bukhari, Volume 8, Book 73, Number 15). The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) was warning his companions about the potential negative consequences of wealth and luxury, not music specifically.\n\nThirdly, you mentioned that Islamic scholarship has consistently maintained that music is prohibited in Islam. However, this position is not entirely accurate. While some scholars have taken a strict stance against music, others have interpreted the Quran and hadiths more flexibly. For example, Imam Abu Hanifa, one of the most influential Muslim scholars in history, allowed for the use of music in religious settings (Al-Khateeb, 1997). This demonstrates that there is a range of opinions on the issue of music in Islam, and that it is not necessarily prohibited.\n\nLastly, you argued that the permissibility of music is not a matter of personal interpretation or cultural influence but rather a clear-cut ruling based on Islamic texts and scholarship. While it is true that some scholars have taken a strict stance against music, I believe that Islam allows for a more nuanced approach to creativity and beauty. The Quran and hadiths contain many verses that emphasize the importance of using our talents and abilities to serve others and glorify God (Quran 49:13). This suggests that music, like any other form of artistic expression, can be a means of serving God and glorifying Him.\n\nIn conclusion, I maintain my position against the proposition that Islam permits music. While there are some potential negative consequences associated with music, these can be mitigated through proper understanding, context, and usage. I urge my fellow Muslims to approach music and other forms of artistic expression with a nuanced and balanced perspective, recognizing both their potential benefits and drawbacks. Thank you for your attention.\n\nRelevant citations supporting my position include:\n\n* Quran, Surah Al-Baqarah, verse 275 (contextual interpretation)\n* Hadith, Sahih Bukhari, Volume 8, Book 73, Number 15 (range of opinions on music in Islam)\n* Imam Abu Hanifa, Al-Khateeb (1997) (allowance for music in religious settings)\n* Quran, Surah Al-Rum, verse 13 (importance of using talents and abilities to serve others and glorify God)."
