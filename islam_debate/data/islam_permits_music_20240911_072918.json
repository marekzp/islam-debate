      "for": "Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed panelists, and fellow debaters, I stand here today in support of the proposition that Islam permits music. This is a topic that has sparked much debate and controversy within the Muslim community, but it is my firm belief that music has a place within Islam and can be enjoyed by Muslims.\n\nFirst and foremost, it is important to recognize that the Quran and Hadith do not explicitly prohibit music. While some scholars may argue that certain types of music with inappropriate content or lyrics may not be permissible, there is no clear-cut prohibition on music as a whole in Islamic teachings. In fact, there are several instances in Islamic history where music was not only permitted but also encouraged. For example, during the time of the Prophet Muhammad, music was present at weddings and other joyful gatherings without censure.\n\nFurthermore, music has been used throughout history as a means of promoting spirituality and connecting with the divine. Sufi Muslims, in particular, have a long tradition of using music and chanting in their spiritual practices to help them achieve a deeper connection with God. The renowned poet and Sufi mystic Rumi once famously said, \"Music is the language of the spirit. It opens the secret of life bringing peace, abolishing strife.\"\n\nAdditionally, it is important to consider the cultural context in which music is enjoyed. Music is a universal language that transcends cultural boundaries and can bring people together in celebration and unity. It can be a source of joy, comfort, and inspiration for many individuals, including Muslims.\n\nIn conclusion, it is my belief that Islam permits music as long as it is enjoyed in a respectful and appropriate manner. Music has a long history within Islamic traditions and can be a tool for promoting spirituality and unity among Muslims and non-Muslims alike. Let us embrace the beauty of music and celebrate its place within our faith.\n\nReferences:\n- Quran, Surah al-Isra (17:64)\n- Hadith of Sahih Muslim, Book 24, Hadith 5165",
      "against": "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining me in this debate on the topic of whether Islam permits music. As a proponent of the belief that Islam does not permit music, I am going to present to you a series of arguments supported by evidence from the Islamic scriptures.\n\nFirstly, let's consider the Hadith, the sayings and actions of the Prophet Muhammad. In Sahih al-Bukhari, one of the most respected and authentic collections of Hadith, it is mentioned that the Prophet Muhammad said, \"There will be among my community people who will consider as permissible adultery, silk, intoxicants and musical instruments\" (Sahih al-Bukhari, 5590). This indicates that the Prophet Muhammad himself warned against the use of musical instruments and considered it impermissible.\n\nFurthermore, in the Quran, the holy book of Islam, there are various verses that emphasize the importance of avoiding sinful and frivolous activities. For example, in Surah Al-An'am, verse 32, it is stated, \"And the poets - [only] the deviators follow them\" (Quran, 26:224). This verse can be interpreted to include musicians and singers among those who lead people astray from the path of righteousness.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple scholars and jurists in Islamic history who have also condemned the practice of music. For example, Imam Shafi'i, one of the founders of one of the four major schools of Islamic jurisprudence, wrote, \"Singing is the amusement of the soul and the food of the foolish... It is the way of prostitutes\" (Albani, Sahih al-Jami, 3314). This demonstrates a strong disapproval of music within traditional Islamic teachings.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the Hadith, Quranic verses, and the opinions of reputable Islamic scholars, it is clear that Islam does not permit music. It is important for Muslims to adhere to the teachings of their faith and avoid engaging in activities that have been deemed sinful or detrimental to one's spiritual wellbeing. Thank you for your attention."

      "for": "Thank you for your arguments, but I respectfully disagree with the notion that Islam does not permit music. While there may be Hadith and interpretations that caution against certain types of music or the misuse of musical instruments, it is important to look at the broader context of Islamic teachings.\n\nFirstly, it is crucial to consider that the Hadith are not all of equal authenticity, and some may have been taken out of context or have different interpretations. It is essential to look at the Hadith in conjunction with the principles of the Quran and the overall spirit of Islam. In Surah Luqman, verse 6, it is mentioned that \"And of the people is he who buys the amusement of speech to mislead [others] from the way of Allah without knowledge and who takes it in ridicule. Those will have a humiliating punishment\" (Quran, 31:6). This verse can be understood as a warning against the misuse of music and entertainment to lead people astray, rather than a blanket prohibition on all forms of music.\n\nFurthermore, it is essential to acknowledge the diverse interpretations within Islamic jurisprudence. While some scholars may have frowned upon music, there are others who have taken a more lenient view. For example, the renowned scholar Ibn Hazm stated, \"There is no harm in beat drums, string instruments, wind instruments, nor in listening to them... unless they are conducive to immorality or distraction from the remembrance of Allah\" (Ibn Hazm, Al-Muhalla, 5/464). This demonstrates that there is room for differing opinions within Islamic scholarship regarding the permissibility of music.\n\nIn conclusion, while there may be differing views among scholars and interpretations of Hadith, it is important to approach the topic of music within Islam with an open mind and a nuanced understanding. Music can be a source of joy, inspiration, and spiritual connection for many individuals, and it deserves to be appreciated within the Islamic tradition. Let us not dismiss the beauty and potential benefits of music within our faith.\n\nReferences:\n- Quran, Surah Luqman (31:6)\n- Ibn Hazm, Al-Muhalla",
      "against": "Thank you for your response. While I appreciate your perspective on the permissibility of music in Islam, I must respectfully disagree with your interpretation. \n\nYou mentioned that Surah Luqman, verse 6, warns against the misuse of speech to mislead others from the way of Allah without knowledge. However, it is important to note that this verse can be understood in conjunction with other Quranic verses and Hadith that specifically mention the prohibition of music and musical instruments. For example, in Sahih al-Bukhari, it is mentioned that the Prophet Muhammad warned against the use of musical instruments (Sahih al-Bukhari, 5590). This Hadith carries significant weight and should not be disregarded when discussing the permissibility of music in Islam.\n\nAdditionally, while it is true that there are varying opinions among Islamic scholars regarding music, it is crucial to consider the consensus among the majority of scholars throughout Islamic history. The stance against music is not limited to a few scholars but is a prevalent viewpoint based on interpretations of the Quran and Hadith. Imam Shafi'i, one of the most respected scholars in Islamic jurisprudence, explicitly stated, \"Singing is the amusement of the soul and the food of the foolish... It is the way of prostitutes\" (Albani, Sahih al-Jami, 3314). This strong condemnation from such a reputable figure illustrates the traditional Islamic perspective on music.\n\nIn conclusion, while there may be differing opinions on the permissibility of music within Islam, it is crucial to prioritize the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad and the consensus of scholars throughout history. The warnings against music in authentic Hadith and the strong disapproval of scholars like Imam Shafi'i serve as compelling evidence that Islam does not permit music. Thank you.\n\nReferences:\n- Sahih al-Bukhari, 5590\n- Albani, Sahih al-Jami, 3314"
