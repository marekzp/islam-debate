      "for": "Ladies and gentlemen, good evening! I am here today to debate a commonly misrepresented issue \u2013 whether Islam permits music or not. My position is that, indeed, Islam does permit music within certain ethical and moral boundaries, a claim that I will support with both textual evidence and leading Islamic voices across history and today.\n\nTo begin with, there is no explicit Quranic verse or Hadith \u2013 the sayings of Prophet Muhammad (Peace Be Upon Him) \u2013 categorically prohibiting music. The Quran, which is the primary source of Islamic law, covers various aspects of life, yet it does not explicitly outlaw music. This silence, one could argue, implies its permissible status.\n\nThe second reason lies within Islamic history. Reviews of Islamic tradition reveal that music was an integral part of Arab culture, and no direct opposition to it was made by the Prophet Muhammad. The renowned Sahih Bukhari narrates Hadith that signify Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) listening to girls singing on feast days and even expressing his enjoyment (Sahih al-Bukhari 907). \n\nIn fact, many distinguished Islamic scholars hold the view that music, much like any other form of art, can be permissible if it encourages positive emotions and morally upright behavior. Sheikh Yusuf Qaradawi, a leading contemporary Islamic scholar, for instance, states, \"Singing is not haram (prohibited) in itself, but the content of the songs is the matter that decides whether it is lawful or not\" (Qaradawi, Yusuf, The Lawful and the Prohibited in Islam, American Trust Publications, 1960).\n\nLet me be clear, the argument here is not that all forms of music are permissible in Islam. Music with inappropriate lyrics, promoting immorality or harm to others, is widely considered Haram (prohibited). The point being made is that music, per se, is not Haram \u2013 it depends on the nature of the music and the manner of its use.\n\nIn conclusion, the claim that Islam permits music aligns with both the absence of explicit prohibitions within Islamic texts and the views of noted Islamic scholars, all testament to the prevailing misconception that music is entirely forbidden in Islam.\n\nLet's approach this debate, not looking to cast labels of permissibility or prohibition on music wholesale, but rather to understand the nuanced position of the Islamic tradition on this issue. In doing so, I believe we will affirm the position that music is indeed permissible under the right conditions within the Islamic faith.",
      "against": "Ladies and Gentlemen,\n\nIn our discussion today, we attempt to shed light on the complex issue of music in the Islamic faith. After extensive research and consideration of the subject at hand, I firmly stand opposed to the proposition stating that Islam unequivocally permits music. And I will present my argument relying heavily on the evidences from the Quran, Hadith (sayings of the Prophet Muhammad PBUH), and the consensus of Islamic scholars. \n\nOur argument is not to claim that the Islamic faith is anti-art or anti-expression but to clarify what is considered permissible and what isn't within the faith itself. Now, to refute the assertion that Islam universally allows music, we should be aware of some fundamental points.\n\nPrimarily, The Holy Quran, the final testament to mankind from God, does not provide a direct verdict on music but influences our perceptions through its message of pure monotheism, balanced life, and moral consciousness. In Surah Luqman (31:6), it is stated: \"And of mankind is he who pays for things to make fun of (or let people hear it) from Hadith, without knowledge, to mislead from Allah's way, making a mockery of it. Those will have a humiliating torment.\" (Safi Kaskas, The Holy Quran in Today's English) While discussions are ongoing in scholarly circles, some interpret 'idle talk' or 'Lahwal Hadith' as music and singing that diverts a person from the remembrance of Allah.\n\nSecondly, let's refer to the Hadiths, where we have explicit statements suggesting the Prophet's disapproval of musical instruments. A hadith by Imam Bukhari and Imam Muslim, the most authentic compilers of Hadith, narrates from Abu Amir or Abu Malik Al-Ashari that the Prophet PBUH said, \"From among my followers, there will be some people who will consider illegal sexual intercourse, the wearing of silk, the drinking of alcoholic drinks, and the use of musical instruments as lawful.\" (Sahih al-Bukhari 5590)\n\nFinally, there is a significant descriptor of what Muslims should follow within Sharia (Islamic law), known as ijma (the consensus of scholars). Eminent scholars such as Imam Ibn Taymiyyah, Imam Shafi'i, and Imam Malik, have stated the impermissibility of music with the exception of Duff, a particular hand drum, on certain occasions like weddings and other celebrations.\n\nThis is only the tip of the iceberg, and as we delve deeper into this debate, we shall uncover more explicit evidences. I urge you to remember that this stance does not reflect a verdict against human expression or music in general, but it seeks to illuminate the teachings and interpretations with respect to the permissibility of music in this particular faith. Thank you."

      "for": "Ladies and Gentlemen,\n\nIt is indeed crucial to explore the depths of Islamic teachings to thoroughly investigate this multifaceted debate. While my opponent's argument sheds light on important views about music's permissibility in Islam, I believe it is only presenting one perspective.\n\nWhen interpreting verses from the Quran, it is vital to refrain from drawing conclusory interpretations based on personal understandings. Quranic text is layered and requires contextual understanding and scholarly interpretations. The verse Surah Luqman (31:6), quoted by my opponent, refers to 'Lahwal Hadith' or 'idle talk' without specifically pointing out music. Renowned Islamic scholar, Yusuf Ali, interprets 'Lahwal Hadith' as 'vain discourses' or 'vain talk,' asserting that it could apply to a variety of distractions, and not necessarily targeted at music (Ali, Abdullah Yusuf. The Holy Qur'an: Text, Translation and Commentary, Tahrike Tarsile Quran, 1987). \n\nAlso, the mentioned Hadith by Imam Bukhari \u2013 Sahih al-Bukhari 5590 \u2013 has varied interpretations. Some scholars interpret the phrase 'the use of musical instruments' as permissible, provided it does not contain immoral or harmful content and doesn't distract from duties or worship (El-Masri, Smyrna. Music and Singing in Islam: In Light of the Qur'an, the Sunnah and the Consensus of Our Great Scholars, Minaret Books, 2006). \n\nMoreover, scholars like Imam Al-Ghazzali & Sheikh Yusuf Qaradawi have expressed permissibility for music and singing as long as they aren't associated with sinful activities or behaviors (Al-Ghazzali, The Revival of Religious Sciences, Nicolle, 1910.; Qaradawi, Yusuf, The Lawful and the Prohibited in Islam, American Trust Publications, 1960). \n\nAs my opponent rightly noted, Ijma (consensus) plays a pivotal role in interpreting Islamic principles. However, there is no universal consensus among scholars about the blanket prohibition of Music in Islam. \n\nOn that note, let's bear in mind that debating interpretations of complicated religious texts often results in varied outlooks. Hence, we continue to stress that music, inherently, is not seen as forbidden in Islam, but it is the context in which it is used that determines its permissibility.",
      "against": "Ladies and Gentlemen,\n\nMy esteemed opponent\u2019s argument has brought forth important points, and yet, in a similar vein, they inadvertently affirm the complexity and the scope of interpretation within the Islamic teachings we discuss today. \n\nThe Holy Quran indeed speaks in extensive metaphors and deep layers that require contextual understanding. Though 'Lahwal Hadith' from Surah Luqman (31:6) does not directly translate to music, we must remember that Tafseer\u2014interpretations of Quran \u2014are not arbitrarily subjective. They are regulated by deep-rooted traditions, scholarly rationale, linguistic knowledge, and an understanding of historical context. \n\nIf we take esteemed scholars like Imam Qurtubi's interpretation, he considers 'Lahwal Hadith' to include 'useless speech, every sound, and every act that distract the heart from God' (Imam Qurtubi, Al-J\u0101mi` li-A\u1e25k\u0101m al-Qur'\u0101n, Dar al-Kutub al-\u2018Ilmiyah, 2014). An interpretation that, by extension, can include much of today's music full of potentially distracting elements.\n\nMoving on to the Hadith referred by both of us. It is indeed true that an alternate interpretation might not consider music as haram. However, even this permissibility has its stringent limitations and specific circumstances, like the narration where the Prophet PBUH allowed two slave girls to sing during Eid with the use of Duff (Sahih Al-Bukhari 949). This clearly implies that the general scenario is prohibitive with outlier allowances.\n\nMoreover, it should be noted that Imam Ghazzali's endorsement of music is pertaining to Samaa, a spiritual kind of music in a religious context (Imam Al-Ghazali, Ihya Uloom-ud-Deen, Darul Syed. 1982). This is a far cry from the contemporary concept of music today.\n\nMeanwhile, Sheikh Qaradawi also presents a nuanced perspective where he distinguishes between music that might elevate the soul toward righteousness and music that can tarnish the soul (Qaradawi, Yusuf. The Lawful and the Prohibited in Islam, American Trust Publications, 1960). His endorsement is therefore for music free from provocative or sinful content and does not incite negligence of religious duties.\n\nAs for the consensus, yes, absolute uniformity, especially in non-fundamental matters like this, is hard to come by. Nevertheless, we find a predominant frequency in major Islamic school of thoughts that music, except for specified exceptions, is not permissible (Al-Qaradawi, Yusuf. The Lawful and the Prohibited in Islam, American Trust Publications, 1960).\n\nTo wrap up, it is worth underscoring this debate is not about permitting or rejecting music as a form of expression or as an art. It is about what Islamic teachings and interpretations convey about the permissibility of music within the context of this faith. Any interpretation thereof must be rooted in a profound understanding of the text, tradition, and overall spirit and objectives of the Islamic faith itself. Thank you."

    "conclusions": {
      "for": "Ladies and Gentlemen,\n\nAs we draw this enlightening debate to a close, it is crucial to revisit the crucial points made throughout. We have delved deep into the Islamic faith, interpreting Quranic verses, Hadiths, and scholarly opinions, all in an effort to probe into the nuanced stance of Islam regarding music.\n\nWhile it is evident from our discussion that this topic is complex, open to multiple perspectives and interpretations, the primary argument that I have presented does not contend that every form of music is permissible within Islam. Rather, the point I wish to emphasize is that music, inherently, is not categorically forbidden in Islam.\n\nThrough our exploration, it was clear that there existed no explicit verse in the Quran prohibiting music. Furthermore, reviewing Islamic history informs us that music was indeed an integral part of Arab culture. Various Hadiths demonstrate instances where Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) did not object to people around him engaging in music and singing, under specific circumstances. \n\nThis position is echoed by several esteemed Islamic scholars, such as Sheikh Yusuf Qaradawi and Imam Al-Ghazzali, who hold that music can be permissible, as long as it promotes positive emotions, moral behavior and does not contain harmful or inappropriate content.\n\nIn conclusion, we assert that while aspects of music can, indeed, fall into the Haram (prohibited) category depending on its content and usage, the essential premise of music is not forbidden in Islam. The complexities and multiple interpretations evident in this debate underline the importance of exercising judicious understanding when assigning permissibility within any faith.\n\nLet's remember that religions, including Islam, are often more layered and nuanced than they are perceived be. And, more often than not, it is within these intricacies that the true beauty of faith lies. Thank you.",
      "against": "Ladies and Gentlemen,\n\nIn concluding this enlightening debate, I would like to emphasize upon the assertion that the Islamic faith, like many others, is layered with profound meanings and interpretations that necessarily ought to be approached with respectful understanding and comprehensive knowledge of its scriptures.\n\nOur argument maintains that Islam doesn't permit music universally, an assertion based not on mere personal bias or perspective, but on extensive research into the Quran, Hadith, and consensus of credible Islamic scholars. We've discussed that Quranic verse Surah Luqman (31:6) can be interpreted to include music as a possible 'idle talk' or 'Lahwal Hadith' that distracts from remembering Allah, while adhering to the principles of Tafseer.\n\nWe've also referenced Hadith Sahih al-Bukhari 5590, where Prophet Muhammad warned about people who would consider the use of musical instruments as lawful. Although there are exceptions in different contexts, the general Islamic rule is the prohibition of music.\n\nIn our discussion of Ijma (consensus), we acknowledged that certain scholars permit music, but it's generally seen as Samaa or spiritual music in a religious context, highlighting a stark contrast to our contemporary understanding of music.\n\nIn sum, my argument seeks to shed light on the teachings of Islam concerning music. While we respect the varied interpretations as presented by my esteemed opponent, we submit that overall, within the Islamic faith and as governed by its texts, traditions, and scholarly opinions, music, except for specific exceptions in distinctive circumstances, is typically regarded as not permissible.\n\nThank you all for a rewarding and respectful debate. This debate has moved beyond mere competition and has enriched our understanding of an intricate aspect of one of the world's major religions."
