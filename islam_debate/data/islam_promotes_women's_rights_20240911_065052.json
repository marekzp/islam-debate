      "for": "Ladies and Gentlemen, Esteemed Judges, Honorable Audience,\n\nI am here today to support the proposition that indeed, Islam promotes women's rights. Now, you might be wondering based on prevailing stereotypes and misconceptions - how could this possibly be true? Let me assure you, the reality of Islam's teachings on women's rights are greatly misunderstood due to cultural interpretations and a lack of knowledge on the basic principles of Islamic faith.\n\nThe truth is, more than 1,400 years ago, when much of the world was in the dark ages concerning rights and respect for women, Islam proposed a comprehensive set of rights for women. Islamic teachings emphasize that men and women are equal in the eyes of God, and they should be treated equally in society as well. It grants women civil rights, spiritual rights, social rights, and yes\u2014political rights.\n\nThe Holy Quran, the word of God as revealed to the Prophet Muhammad, forms the basis of Islamic law and values. Let's look at a particular verse, \"O mankind, We have created you from a male and a female, and made you into nations and tribes that you may know one another. Verily, the most honorable of you with Allah is that (believer) who has At-Taqwa [i.e. who is pious and righteous]\" (Al-Hujurat 49:13). Here, gender distinction is erased and the fundamental criterion for determining an individual's worth is his or her personal piety and righteousness.\n\nMoreover, Islam guarantees the right to education for both men and women. Prophet Muhammad stated, \"Seeking knowledge is a mandate for every Muslim (male and female).\"(Sunnan Ibn Ma\u0304jah 224). This declaration includes, but is not limited to, the right to learn, teach, and participate in scholarly endeavors.\n\nIslam brought about legal rights for women in marriage and divorce at a time when they had none. For instance, the Quran promises women the right to choose whom they marry, and to divorce if necessary (The Quran, 2:229 and 4:19). It also guarantees women are given a Mahr, a non-returnable mandatory gift as part of the marriage contract (The Quran, 4:4).\n\nIn regards to economic rights, contrary to western modern principles, Islam granted women the right to own and control their property without any guardianship over their property in any shape or form. (The Quran, 4:32) Islam also ensured women had the right to inheritance (The Quran, 4:7).\n\nIn the political sphere, Islamic history accounts for various Muslim women who played significant roles. The Prophet's wife, Aisha (R.A.), was a major contributor to Islamic jurisprudence, a political leader, and an army commander, serving as a pioneer for women's rights in Islam.\n\nIn conclusion, the problem lies not with Islam itself, but with cultural interpretations, human practices, and the sin of ignorance. Islam, as its text and history suggest, champions the cause of women and their rights.\n\nI look forward to unpacking and discussing these points further in the promises of this debate.\n\nReferences:\n\n1.

      "against": "Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed judges, and respected opponents, I stand before you to make my case against the proposition that 'Islam promotes women's rights.'\n\nFirst and foremost, my argument isn't with Islam as a faith, which can indeed be interpreted in many ways, but with a system of religious interpretation and political governance that has historically subordinated women in majority-Muslim societies. This is an issue innately tied to human rights, equality, and dignity, and our discussion today must proceed with a profound respect for these principles.\n\nIn many countries where Islam is the predominant faith, we often witness a pervading interpretation of Islamic law or Sharia that systematically discriminates against women, notably by diminishing their rights to divorce and inheritance, and perpetuating harmful practices such as child marriage (Carroll, 2009; Eltahawy, 2016). This interpretation is the subject of my contention.\n\nIn terms of legal rights under Sharia, find me a woman who possesses equal rights to divorce as her male counterpart, and there would be little for us to dispute. However, the reality symbolizes the harsh contrast to the equality that's essential in upholding women's rights. For example, in Islamic law, men can divorce quite simply by saying, \"I divorce you\" three times (khul'), while women must navigate a complicated legal process with various stipulations and limitations (Hallaq, 2009). \n\nMoreover, under Islamic inheritance laws, a daughter gets half the share of her brother - a direct violation of the principle of gender equality that is internationally accepted (UNHCR, 2013). Further, the public sphere of life, such as work, politics and law-making are forcefully dominated by men, reducing women to the private sphere (Hassan, 1999). \n\nThen there's the unfortunate reality of child marriage, which UNICEF records as being as high as 70% in some majority-Muslim countries, primarily because of interpretations that allow marriage upon a girl's first menstruation (UNICEF, 2018). \n\nIn conclusion, I emphasize that my argument isn't with the faith of Islam itself, but with interpretations and implementations of Islamic principles in ways that limit women's rights. The question isn't whether Islam can promote women's rights, but rather, how Islamic societies choose to interpret and apply these principles. That, esteemed audience, is where our focus should be.\n\nReferences:\n1. Carroll, Lucy. (2009). Law, Custom and Statutory Social Reform, in Women in Modern India.

      "for": "Esteemed Judges, Honorable Audience, and Respected Opponent,\n\nI appreciate your points and the respectful manner in which they were presented. The issues you raise are indeed of critical importance. However, I believe that what is problematic are not the principles of Islam, but rather the interpretation and implementation of Islamic teachings and principles by certain individuals and societies. \n\nYour argument addresses the disparity in divorce rights for men and women. It's true that in some societies, uneducated application of Islamic rules favored men. However, the ease of initiating a divorce for men was intended given their societal responsibilities at that time, not as a sign of women's inferiority. Yet, women still retain the right to seek divorce (khula') under grounds including, but not limited to, mistreatment, incompatibility, and financial instability, safeguarding women's right to dissolve a marriage (DeLong-Bas, 2001).\n\nThe interpretation of inheritance laws you pointed out, indeed dictates that a male family member inherits twice as much as his female equivalent. But it's significant to note that it's the man's responsibility, according to Islamic law, to financially provide for the females in his family, a burden not placed on women (Basarudin, 2010). The laws of inheritance therefore must be seen in the broader context of Islamic regulations on financial responsibilities, where gender roles are intricately interconnected. \n\nYour statement about child marriages, while distressing, should not be attributed to Islam. You rightly stated that child marriages exist due to societal interpretations allowing marriage upon a girl's first menstruation; however, this cultural practice is prevalent in many societies, regardless of their religious beliefs (Bunting, 2005). The Prophet Muhammad mandated for the parties in a marriage to be mature and capable of making an independent decisions. (Al-Bukhari and Muslim).\n\nMoreover, the dominance of men in public life is not a stipulation of Islam, but rather a common feature of patriarchal cultures worldwide. Islam does not mandate gender segregation in the professional or political world. For instance, the Prophet Mohammad's first wife, Khadijah, was a successful trader and one of the most powerful women in Arabia (Ahmed, 2012).\n\nIn essence, the gap between principles and practice in the realm of women's rights in many Muslim societies is not indicative of Islam's principles, but rather their misguided implementation. Hence, our focus should indeed be on interpreting and applying the principles of Islam accurately, intelligibly, and justly.\n\nReferences:\n\n1. DeLong-Bas, N.J. (2001).

      "against": "Honorable Judges, Esteemed Audience, and Respected Opponent,\n\nI am thankful for my opponent\u2019s considered response and the further opportunity to engage in this enriching debate. However, I still hold my stance against the proposition, and allow me explain why.\n\nWhile my opponent rightly argues that the difficulties women face when seeking divorce within Islamic laws, called khula', were intended to be a safety net, the reality of the situation often portrays a different picture. Women, particularly in lower socio-economic classes, often lack access to the legal resources needed to navigate this process, resulting in an unequal system that ties them to unhappy or abusive marriages (N\u00ed Aol\u00e1in et al., 2011). \n\nAs for inheritance, I understand it to be a man's responsibility within various Islamic contexts to financially provide for women. But, does this arrangement champion women's independence or tie their freedom and socio-economic success solely to a male figure? Wouldn't women receiving an equal share and being expected to contribute, as men are, ultimately promote their independence and uphold their rights more substantially (Mir-Hosseini, 2006)?\n\nMy opponent suggests that child marriage should not be attributed to Islam but is a societal malpractice. I agree to an extent. It is indeed a societal issue prevalent across various cultures. However, the fact that this practice is condoned and perpetuated by interpretations of Islamic law in many societies cannot be denied (Chowdhury Elora, 2020).\n\nLastly, attributing the disenfranchisement of women in public life solely to patriarchal culture overlooks how in many regions it is justified through religious interpretations (Afary, 2019). While the Prophet Mohammed\u2019s first wife was successful in her times, it can't be ignored that in many contemporary Islamic settings, Khadijah\u2019s example is far from the norm. \n\nIn conclusion, I affirm my previous argument, that my issue is not with Islam, but with the interpretations and application of its laws, and the resulting impacts on women\u2019s rights in many societies. Let's focus on challenging interpreters of the law who fail to uphold equality and justice for all.\n\nReferences:\n\n1. N\u00ed Aol\u00e1in, F., Haynes, D. F., & Cahn, N. R. (Eds.). (2011).

      "for": "Esteemed Judges, Honorable Audience, and Respected Opponent,\n\nThroughout the course of this debate, my primary objective has been to underscore that Islam, as a faith and as a philosophical system, fundamentally promotes and values the rights of women. The principles of Islam - as laid out in its primary texts - have the bedrock of equality, respect, and empowerment for women, making it centuries ahead of its time in providing women with civil, political and economic rights.\n\nIndeed, societal interpretations and practices found in certain communities, as emphasized by my opponent, don't reflect the essence of Islamic teachings but represent divergent cultural practices. While it's undeniable that there are communities where harmful and unjust practices towards women exist under the umbrella of \"Islam,\" it must be emphasized that these practices are a distortion and misinterpretation of the religion's teachings. Furthermore, many of these issues are not exclusive to Muslim societies but are widespread across societies with different cultural and religious contexts.\n\nWomen\u2019s rights in terms of marriage and divorce, education, inheritance, and participation in public life are all entrenched in Islamic theology, putting to rest any misconceptions that the faith inherently subjugates women. The disparity that subsists between the principles and their application in some cultures is not indicative of Islamic principles, rather, their inaccurate interpretation and implementation. \n\nThe Prophet Muhammad's own life was filled with examples of honoring and respecting women, and he treated women with compassion and respect. The Prophet's wives were successful businesswomen, scholars, political leaders, highlighting that women's active role in public life is not incompatible with Islam.\n\nIn conclusion, while it's crucial to challenge and rectify the socially and culturally derived practices harming women in many societies worldwide, it's equally important to acknowledge Islam's inherent respect for women's rights and potential. It is my hope that our debate today has fostered a deeper understanding of this subject and will inspire continued examination and discussion, leading us towards a more equitable world. \n\nWith this, I rest my case, grateful for the opportunity to discuss such a crucial topic.",
      "against": "Esteemed Judges, Respected Audience, and Honorable Opponent,\n\nI am grateful for the engaging, thought-provoking debate. I reiterate that my argument is not with Islam as a faith, but with the ways in which its principles have been interpreted and applied in many instances, often resulting in the subjugation of women\u2019s rights.\n\nThe disparity that exists for women in obtaining divorce under Sharia laws emphasizes unequal access to justice. A system that requires women, particularly those marginalized by society, to endure an intricate legal process to exit a marriage exhibits inherent negation of gender equality.\n\nWhile it's noted that men bear the financial responsibility in Islamic traditions, the inheritance laws and their application compromise women's rights to socio-economic security and independence. The importance of regulating inheritance in a way that bolsters women\u2019s independence rather than tying it to a male figure cannot be overstated.\n\nThe prevalence of child marriages in several Islamic societies, accepted under interpretations of Islamic law, constitutes a violation of child rights, pushing us to question the alignment between these interpretations and the faith's inherent principles.\n\nIn the same vein, the marginalization of women in public spheres, often justified by religious interpretations in many Islamic contexts, contradicts with the example set by the Prophet Mohammad's wife, Khadijah, a successful businesswoman, further intensifying the need for a more egalitarian interpretation of Islamic principles.\n\nTherefore, my argument does not center on whether Islam can promote women's rights, but how it is interpreted and put into practice in various societies, ultimately shaping the lives of women. The sesquipedalian journey towards achieving gender equality and women's rights needs an informed, fair, and just interpretation of all religious doctrines, including Islam. Hence, our focus should be on challenging interpretations that fail to uphold justice and equality for all.\n\nThank you, and let us not forget that our dedication and engagement in such debates brings us one step closer to a world permeated with greater justice, equality, and dignity for all individuals, regardless of gender or belief."
