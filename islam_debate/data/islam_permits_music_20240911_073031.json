      "for": "Respected judges, esteemed participants, and fellow audience members, I stand before you today to argue that Islam does indeed permit music. This stance is supported by historical evidence and scholarly interpretations of the Qur'an and Sunnah (the teachings and practices of the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him).\n\nFirst and foremost, it is important to note that the Qur'an, the holy book of Islam, does not contain any explicit prohibition against music or musical instruments. While some scholars have interpreted certain verses as discouraging certain types of music or musical practices, there is no clear-cut injunction against music as a whole.\n\nIn fact, there are several instances in the Qur'an where the concept of singing or chanting is mentioned in a positive light. For example, in Surah Al-Isra (17:44), Allah says: \"And We have indeed sent down the Qur'an, and indeed it guides to the path that is most straight.\" This verse is often interpreted as encouraging the melodious recitation of the Qur'an, which is a form of music itself.\n\nMoreover, numerous hadith (sayings and actions of the Prophet Muhammad) indicate that music was accepted and even encouraged in certain contexts. For instance, in a hadith narrated by Al-Bukhari, the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) is reported to have said: \"Allah has not burdened us with anything regarding the chanting of poetry or the like.\" This hadith suggests that the Prophet did not prohibit the art of poetry recitation, which often involved melodic elements.\n\nAdditionally, there are historical accounts of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) allowing and participating in celebrations where music and singing were present, such as on the occasions of weddings or the return of travelers (Sahih al-Bukhari, Book 62, Hadith 11).\n\nIt is worth noting that many renowned Islamic scholars throughout history have acknowledged the permissibility of music within certain boundaries. For example, the renowned scholar Al-Ghazali (1058-1111 CE) wrote in his book \"Ihya Ulum al-Din\" (The Revival of the Religious Sciences) that music is permitted as long as it does not lead to sinful behavior or the consumption of intoxicants (Al-Ghazali, Ihya Ulum al-Din, Book 15, Chapter 5).\n\nIn conclusion, while there may be differing opinions and interpretations among scholars, the evidence from the Qur'an, Sunnah, and Islamic scholarly tradition suggests that music is not categorically prohibited in Islam. Rather, it is a matter of moderation, intention, and ensuring that the music does not promote unethical or immoral behavior. Therefore, I urge you to consider this compelling evidence and recognize that Islam does indeed permit music within certain boundaries and guidelines.",
      "against": "Here is a possible opening argument against the proposition that Islam permits music, along with relevant citations:\n\nRespected opponents, honorable judges, and esteemed audience. I stand before you today to argue against the proposition that Islam permits music. While there are differing views among Islamic scholars on this issue, strong evidence from the Quran and authentic Hadith suggests that music is generally prohibited in Islam.\n\nFirst, let us consider the word of Allah in the Quran, which says: \"And of the people is he who buys the amusement of speech to mislead [others] from the way of Allah without knowledge and who takes it in ridicule. Those will have a humiliating punishment.\" (Quran 31:6)\n\nMany scholars have interpreted the phrase \"amusement of speech\" to refer to music, singing, and idle entertainment that distracts from the remembrance of Allah. Ibn Kathir, the renowned Islamic scholar, stated in his Tafsir that this verse clearly prohibits \"all that is false and unbeneficial like singing, music, and dancing.\" (Tafsir Ibn Kathir)\n\nMoreover, there are several authentic Hadith that reinforce this prohibition. The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said: \"From among my followers there will be some people who will seek to make lawful: adultery, silk, alcohol, and musical instruments.\" (Bukhari)\n\nIn another Hadith, the Prophet cursed the person who plays music, saying: \"Allah's Apostle cursed the lady who practices tattoo and the one who gets it done, and the lady who lengthens hair artificially and the one who does it.\" (Bukhari)\n\nBased on these clear verses from the Quran and authentic Hadith, many of the most respected Islamic scholars throughout history like Ibn Taymiyyah, Al-Ghazali, and Ibn Hazm have ruled that music is impermissible in Islam, as it distracts from the worship of Allah and can lead to immorality.\n\nWhile some may argue there are exceptions, like vocal or religious songs without instruments, the general principle is one of prohibition of music, singing, and Entertainment that dulls spirituality. As Muslims, we must be guided by the Word of Allah and the teachings of our beloved Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him)."

    "round_1": {
      "for": "As the proponent of the view that Islam permits music, I will respectfully address the arguments presented by the opposition while strengthening my stance with additional evidence from Islamic sources.\n\nFirst, let us examine the verse from the Quran cited by the opposition (31:6). While some scholars have interpreted the phrase \"amusement of speech\" as referring to music, this interpretation is not conclusive. Many other scholars have understood this verse to be a condemnation of idle talk, falsehood, and mockery, rather than a blanket prohibition of music. For instance, the renowned exegete Al-Tabari interpreted this verse as referring to \"falsehoods and indecent speech\" (Tafsir Al-Tabari, 19:190).\n\nFurthermore, the hadith quoted by the opposition regarding the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) cursing those who engage in certain practices should be understood in their proper context. According to scholars like Al-Nawawi, the hadith about cursing those who practice tattoos and lengthen hair artificially refers specifically to practices associated with pagan rituals during the Prophet's time (Sharh Muslim, 14:117). It does not necessarily extend to a general condemnation of all music.\n\nSimilarly, the hadith mentioning those who seek to make lawful \"adultery, silk, alcohol, and musical instruments\" is considered by many scholars to be a weak (da'if) narration, lacking strong chains of transmission (Silsilat al-Ahadith al-Da'ifah, Al-Albani). Even if accepted, it can be interpreted as a warning against the excessive pursuit of worldly pleasures, not a categorical prohibition of music.\n\nOn the other hand, we have numerous examples from the life of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) that suggest the permissibility of music within certain boundaries. For instance, in the famous hadith narrated by Al-Bukhari, the Prophet allowed the celebration of weddings with the playing of a duff (a simple hand-drum) and singing (Sahih al-Bukhari, Book 62, Hadith 11).\n\nMoreover, the respected companion of the Prophet, Anas ibn Malik, reported that the Prophet once entered Medina and saw people celebrating a wedding, and he said: \"The Ansar are fond of good things, and I love whatever they love\" (Sunan al-Tirmidhi, Hadith 1078). This implies that the Prophet approved of celebrations with music and singing, as long as they were within the bounds of Islamic morality.\n\nIt is also worth noting that many renowned Islamic scholars throughout history have acknowledged the permissibility of music, albeit with certain conditions and restrictions. For example, the eminent scholar Al-Ghazali, whom the opposition cited, did not categorically prohibit music. Rather, he distinguished between permissible and impermissible forms of music, stating that \"listening to poetry and music that does not excite lust or lead to immorality is not forbidden\" (Ihya Ulum al-Din, Book 15, Chapter 5).\n\nIn conclusion, while there are differing interpretations among scholars, the evidence from the Quran, authentic Hadith, and Islamic scholarly tradition suggests that music is not categorically prohibited in Islam. Rather, it is a matter of moderation, intention, and ensuring that the music does not promote unethical or immoral behavior. As long as these conditions are met, music can be viewed as a permissible form of art and expression in Islam.",
      "against": "I appreciate the arguments presented by my opponent, but I must respectfully disagree with their interpretation and continue to assert that Islam prohibits music based on the following counterpoints:\n\n1. Regarding the interpretation of Quran 31:6, while some scholars have differed, the majority view held by eminent scholars like Ibn Kathir, Ibn Taymiyyah, and Al-Qurtubi is that the \"amusement of speech\" refers to music and singing (Tafsir Ibn Kathir, Majmu' al-Fatawa by Ibn Taymiyyah, Al-Jami' li Ahkam al-Quran by Al-Qurtubi). Their understanding, based on the context and language used, should carry more weight.\n\n2. Concerning the hadith about the Prophet cursing those involved in certain practices, my opponent's interpretation is not supported by the majority of scholars. Al-Nawawi himself did not restrict this hadith to pagan rituals alone (Sharh Muslim). Additionally, other authentic hadiths clearly prohibit music, such as the one narrated by Abu 'Amir or Abu Malik Al-Ash'ari, where the Prophet said, \"From among my followers, there will be some people who will seek to make permissible: illegal sexual relations, silk (for men), alcohol, and musical instruments\" (Al-Bukhari, Book 69, Hadith 494).\n\n3. The examples cited of the Prophet allowing celebrations with a duff (hand-drum) and singing are exceptions that do not negate the general prohibition. Many scholars, including Ibn Hazm and Ibn Taymiyyah, have differentiated between the permissibility of the duff and the impermissibility of other musical instruments (Maratib al-Ijma' by Ibn Hazm, Majmu' al-Fatawa by Ibn Taymiyyah).\n\n4. While some scholars like Al-Ghazali have allowed certain forms of music, the overwhelming majority of classical and contemporary scholars have ruled it to be impermissible. Even Al-Ghazali's stance is heavily qualified, and he prohibits music that encourages lust or immorality (Ihya Ulum al-Din). The general principle in Islam is to avoid doubtful matters, and music falls into this category according to the majority view.\n\n5. The argument that music is permissible as long as it does not promote immorality is flawed. Music, by its very nature, can be a means of diversion from the remembrance of Allah and a pathway to moral corruption, as warned in the Quran and Hadith. The Prophetic tradition emphasizes caution and avoiding such avenues, even if they may seem permissible to some.\n\nIn conclusion, while there may be differing views among scholars, the preponderance of evidence from the Quran, authentic Hadith, and the interpretations of the majority of classical and contemporary scholars points to the prohibition of music in Islam, with a few exceptions. As Muslims, we should err on the side of caution and adhere to the safer and more widely accepted position, which is to abstain from music and focus our efforts on that which pleases Allah and brings us closer to Him."

As Muslims, we should strive to appreciate and engage with the arts, including music, in a manner that uplifts our spirituality and promotes ethical values, rather than adopting a blanket prohibition that lacks firm grounding in the primary sources of our faith.",
      "against": "Here is a potential concluding statement for the debate, summarizing the position against the proposition that Islam permits music and the key points made:\n\nRespected judges, honorable opponents, and esteemed audience. Throughout this debate, I have presented strong evidence from the Quran, authentic Hadith, and the interpretations of the overwhelming majority of classical and contemporary Islamic scholars to argue that Islam generally prohibits music.\n\nThe core arguments are as follows: Firstly, verses like Quran 31:6 have been widely understood by eminent exegetes to refer to the prohibition of music and idle entertainment that distracts from the remembrance of Allah. Secondly, numerous authentic Hadith narrations explicitly condemn and curse those who engage with musical instruments and indecent forms of entertainment.\n\nWhile a few exceptions exist, such as the permissibility of the simple duff drum in certain celebratory contexts, these do not negate the general prohibition emphasized across Islamic scriptural sources and scholarly tradition. Even scholars who allowed some forms of music, like Al-Ghazali, heavily qualified and restricted it to prevent moral corruption.\n\nMoreover, the very nature of music as a means of diversion and a potential pathway to immorality should compel Muslims to err on the side of caution and abstain from it, in line with the principles of the Shari'ah and the guidance of our beloved Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him).\n\nWhile differing views exist, the preponderance of evidence supports the stance that Islam prohibits music, barring a few exceptions. As Muslims, we must prioritize adherence to the Word of Allah, the teachings of the Prophet, and the guidance of the majority of respected scholars who have dedicated their lives to the study and preservation of our sacred tradition.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the clear textual evidence, scholarly interpretations, and the overall spirit of Islamic teachings emphasizing moderation, spirituality, and avoidance of doubtful matters, the proposition that Islam permits music cannot be upheld. We must strive to align our actions with the pleasure of Allah and the noble example set by our Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him)."
