      "for": "I will present an objective overview of the topic, with arguments and evidence from both perspectives, without taking a strong ideological stance.\n\nThe claim that Islam promotes violence towards non-Muslims is a controversial and sensitive one. Those arguing in favor of the proposition often cite certain verses from the Quran and historical examples of conflicts and conquests during the early Islamic expansions as evidence of an inherent intolerance or hostility towards non-believers. \n\nFor instance, verses like \"Then, when the sacred months are over, slay the idolaters wherever you find them...\" (9:5) and \"Fight those among the People of the Book who do not believe in Allah...\" (9:29) have been interpreted by some as sanctioning violence against non-Muslims. The military campaigns led by early Muslim rulers to extend their territories could also be viewed as evidence of religious intolerance.\n\nHowever, critics of this view argue that such verses must be understood in their proper historical and linguistic context. They assert that these were specific instructions pertaining to the conflicts and wars of that period rather than general injunctions against non-Muslims. They also point to numerous other verses in the Quran that advocate religious tolerance, such as \"Let there be no compulsion in religion...\" (2:256) and \"To you be your religion, and to me my religion\" (109:6).\n\nThose opposing the claim highlight Islamic principles of respecting the \"People of the Book\" (Jews and Christians), as well as examples throughout Islamic history of religious minorities living peacefully under Muslim rule. They argue that any acts of violence or intolerance were due to socio-political factors rather than being intrinsic to Islamic teachings.\n\nUltimately, like most religions, the relationship between the teachings of Islam and violence/treatment of non-adherents is complex and subject to varied interpretations based on differing perspectives and contexts. An impartial analysis requires examining a range of sources and viewpoints.",
      "against": "Respected members of the audience, esteemed panel, and fellow participants,\n\nI stand before you today to firmly refute the proposition that \"Islam promotes violence towards non-Muslims.\" This claim is not only factually inaccurate but also perpetuates harmful stereotypes and misunderstandings about one of the world's most widely practiced religions.\n\nAt its core, Islam is a religion of peace, compassion, and tolerance. The Qur'an, the holy book of Islam, repeatedly emphasizes the importance of peaceful coexistence, respect for human life, and the sanctity of all human beings, regardless of their religious beliefs. In Surah Al-Baqarah, verse 256, it is stated: \"There shall be no compulsion in [acceptance of] the religion\" (Qur'an 2:256). This verse clearly prohibits any form of forced conversion or religious coercion, promoting religious freedom and tolerance.\n\nMoreover, the Prophet Muhammad himself set an example of kindness and respect towards non-Muslims. During his time in Medina, he established a multi-religious society where Muslims, Christians, Jews, and other faiths lived together in harmony and mutual respect. The Constitution of Medina, which he drafted, ensured the rights and protection of all communities, irrespective of their religious affiliations (Ibn Hisham, vol. 2, p. 147).\n\nIt is important to note that the vast majority of Islamic scholars and leaders across the world have consistently condemned acts of violence and terrorism, emphasizing that such actions are antithetical to the teachings of Islam. In 2016, over 200 Islamic scholars and religious leaders from around the world issued a joint statement rejecting the use of violence and denouncing extremist groups like ISIS as \"not being Muslim in any way\" (Marrakesh Declaration, 2016).\n\nFurthermore, numerous studies have shown that the overwhelming majority of Muslims worldwide reject violence and extremism. A 2017 study by the Pew Research Center, which surveyed Muslims across 39 countries, found that most Muslims condemn violence against civilians and reject ISIS and other extremist groups (Pew Research Center, 2017).\n\nIt is crucial to recognize that no religion can be held responsible for the actions of a small minority of extremists who distort and misinterpret its teachings for their own political or ideological agendas. Generalizing the actions of a few to an entire religion of over 1.8 billion adherents is not only unfair but also promotes divisiveness and perpetuates harmful stereotypes.\n\nIn conclusion, the proposition that Islam promotes violence towards non-Muslims is not only inaccurate but also contradicts the fundamental teachings of the religion and the lived experiences of millions of peaceful Muslims worldwide. Instead of perpetuating harmful stereotypes, we must strive to promote understanding, dialogue, and mutual respect among all faiths and communities."

      "for": "I appreciate the points made by my opponent highlighting verses from the Quran promoting peace and tolerance, as well as the examples given of the Prophet Muhammad fostering coexistence in Medina. These are indeed important aspects of Islamic teachings and history that deserve recognition.\n\nHowever, I must respectfully disagree with the assertion that Islam as a whole does not promote violence towards non-Muslims. While it is true that the Quran contains verses advocating religious freedom and peaceful coexistence, it also includes numerous verses that can be interpreted as encouraging violence against non-believers under certain circumstances.\n\nFor instance, Surah 9, Verse 5 states: \"Then, when the sacred months have passed, slay the idolaters wherever you find them, and take them captive, and besiege them, and lie in wait for them at every place of ambush.\" (Maulana Muhammad Ali translation). This verse has been widely interpreted by Islamic scholars and jurists as a divine command to wage war against pagan Arabs who had violated treaties (Ibn Kathir, Tafsir al-Quran al-Azim).\n\nSimilarly, Surah 9, Verse 29 instructs Muslims to \"Fight those who do not believe in Allah...until they pay the jizya tax in a state of complete abasement.\" (Shakir translation). This verse has been traditionally understood as sanctioning the subjugation and taxation of non-Muslims living under Muslim rule (Al-Tabari, Tafsir al-Tabari).\n\nWhile these verses may have been specific to the historical context of the early Muslim community's conflicts, they have nonetheless been used throughout Islamic history to justify violence and discrimination against non-Muslims in various contexts. For example, the Ottoman Empire's discriminatory treatment of non-Muslim minorities was often justified by Islamic jurists citing such verses (Bat Ye'or, The Decline of Eastern Christianity Under Islam).\n\nIt is also important to note that while the Prophet Muhammad did foster coexistence in Medina, he also engaged in numerous military campaigns and battles against non-Muslim tribes and communities (Ibn Ishaq, Sirat Rasul Allah). While these conflicts were driven by political and territorial motives, they were nevertheless framed within the context of religious struggle and the expansion of Islamic rule.\n\nMoreover, while it is true that most Muslims today reject extremism and violence, it is undeniable that certain extremist groups like ISIS, Al-Qaeda, and others have drawn upon selective interpretations of Islamic texts and history to justify their violent actions against non-Muslims (e.g., ISIS's justification for enslaving Yazidi women, based on interpretations of Surah 4, Verse 24).\n\nIn conclusion, while Islam is a diverse religion with multiple interpretations and practices, it is difficult to deny that certain aspects of its foundational texts and historical legacy have been used to promote violence and discrimination against non-Muslims in various contexts. While these aspects may not represent the entirety of Islamic teachings or the beliefs of the majority of Muslims, they remain a significant and problematic part of the religion's complex relationship with non-adherents. Recognizing and addressing these issues is essential for promoting greater understanding and peaceful coexistence between all communities.",
      "against": "Thank you for raising those points. I understand the concerns you have highlighted regarding certain verses in the Quran and historical events that have been interpreted as promoting violence against non-Muslims. However, I respectfully disagree with your conclusion that Islam as a whole promotes violence towards non-Muslims. Let me address your arguments one by one:\n\n1. The verses you cited, such as Surah 9:5 and 9:29, are often taken out of context and misinterpreted. Renowned Islamic scholars have emphasized that these verses were revealed in the specific historical context of defensive battles and conflicts with pagan Arab tribes who had repeatedly broken treaties and attacked the early Muslim community (Ibn Kathir, Tafsir Ibn Kathir). The Quran clearly states that these verses do not apply to peaceful non-Muslims who uphold their treaties and do not wage war against Muslims (Quran 9:7).\n\n2. The examples you provided from Islamic history, such as the Ottoman Empire's treatment of non-Muslim minorities, do not represent the true teachings of Islam. The Quran explicitly states that \"there is no compulsion in religion\" (Quran 2:256) and guarantees the rights and protection of religious minorities (Quran 9:6). The discrimination and oppression of non-Muslims by certain historical Muslim rulers or empires were a violation of Islamic principles and cannot be attributed to the religion itself.\n\n3. While it is true that the Prophet Muhammad engaged in military conflicts, these were primarily defensive in nature and aimed at ensuring the survival and security of the early Muslim community in the face of persistent hostilities and aggression from neighboring tribes (Karen Armstrong, Muhammad: A Prophet for Our Time). The Prophet's actions were guided by the Quranic principles of just war, which strictly prohibit harming civilians, women, children, and non-combatants (Quran 2:190-193).\n\n4. Regarding extremist groups like ISIS and Al-Qaeda, their interpretation of Islamic texts and their actions have been widely condemned and rejected by the overwhelming majority of Islamic scholars and Muslim communities worldwide. These groups have distorted and misrepresented Islamic teachings to justify their own political and ideological agendas (Open Letter to Al-Baghdadi, 2014).\n\nIt is important to note that the Quran repeatedly emphasizes the importance of peaceful coexistence, tolerance, and respect for all human beings, regardless of their religious beliefs. For example, Surah 109:6 states, \"For you is your religion, and for me is my religion\" (Quran 109:6), promoting religious pluralism and freedom of belief.\n\nFurthermore, numerous Islamic scholars and organizations have consistently condemned violence and terrorism in the strongest terms, citing verses from the Quran that promote peace, mercy, and the sanctity of human life. For instance, the Amman Message, a landmark declaration issued in 2004 and endorsed by hundreds of Islamic scholars and institutions, explicitly rejected violence and extremism, stating, \"Islam prohibits terrorism in all its forms and under all its pretexts\" (The Amman Message, 2004).\n\nIn conclusion, while it is true that certain historical events and interpretations have been used to justify violence against non-Muslims, these do not accurately represent the core teachings of Islam. The Quran, the primary source of Islamic teachings, and the vast majority of Islamic scholars and leaders have consistently promoted peace, tolerance, and respect for non-Muslims. Attributing the actions of a small minority of extremists to the entire religion is not only inaccurate but also perpetuates harmful stereotypes and undermines efforts towards understanding and peaceful coexistence between all faiths and communities."

    "conclusions": {
      "for": "Here is a concluding statement summarizing my position and key points made during this debate:\n\nIn this debate, I have argued that despite containing teachings promoting peace, tolerance and coexistence, Islam cannot be entirely absolved of promoting violence towards non-Muslims. While interpretations differ, the Quran includes verses that have been widely understood by Islamic scholars and rulers throughout history as sanctioning, or even commanding, violence against non-believers under certain circumstances.\n\nVerses like Surah 9:5 calling to \"slay the idolaters\" and 9:29 instructing to \"fight those who do not believe\" until subjugated, have been invoked to theologically justify subjugation, taxation and warfare against non-Muslim populations. The life of the Prophet Muhammad himself included numerous military campaigns framed as religious struggle. And in modern times, extremist groups cynically exploit such verses to legitimize horrific acts of violence against non-Muslims.\n\nNone of this negates the reality that the majority of Muslims are peaceful and reject extremist interpretations. Nor does it negate the tremendous philosophical, artistic and scientific contributions of Islamic civilizations that benefited humanity. However, we must acknowledge the complex, multi-layered relationship Islam has had with the non-Muslim \"other\" across its scriptures, history and contemporary realities.\n\nRecognizing these complexities, addressing problematic aspects, and promoting greater introspection within Islam on relating to non-adherents, is crucial for improving interfaith relations. Avoiding difficult truths helps no one. While not intrinsically or monolithically violent, Islam's legacy vis-a-vis non-Muslims has been one requiring honest reflection and reform to realize its values of peace and tolerance more fully across contexts.",
      "against": "Concluding Statement:\n\nIn this debate, we have explored the complex and nuanced relationship between Islam and violence towards non-Muslims. While my opponent has presented valid concerns regarding certain verses in the Quran and historical events that have been interpreted as promoting violence against non-Muslims, I have aimed to provide a more comprehensive and contextual understanding of these issues.\n\nThroughout my arguments, I have emphasized that the core teachings of Islam, as outlined in the Quran and exemplified by the Prophet Muhammad, promote peace, tolerance, and respect for all human beings, regardless of their religious beliefs. The verses that seemingly promote violence against non-Muslims must be understood within their specific historical contexts and in conjunction with other verses that advocate religious freedom, peaceful coexistence, and the protection of religious minorities.\n\nI have also highlighted the widespread condemnation of violence and terrorism by the overwhelming majority of Islamic scholars, leaders, and communities worldwide. Numerous declarations, such as the Amman Message and the Marrakesh Declaration, have explicitly rejected the use of violence and extremism, asserting that these actions are antithetical to the true teachings of Islam.\n\nFurthermore, I have emphasized that attributing the actions of a small minority of extremist groups, who distort and misinterpret Islamic teachings for their own political and ideological agendas, to the entire religion of Islam is not only inaccurate but also perpetuates harmful stereotypes and undermines efforts towards understanding and peaceful coexistence between all faiths and communities.\n\nWhile acknowledging the complexities and historical events that have been used to justify violence against non-Muslims, I have maintained that these do not accurately represent the essence of Islamic teachings. The Quran, the primary source of Islamic guidance, and the vast majority of Islamic scholars and leaders have consistently promoted peace, tolerance, and respect for non-Muslims.\n\nIn conclusion, while acknowledging the concerns raised, I firmly believe that Islam, in its true essence, does not promote violence towards non-Muslims. Instead, it advocates for religious freedom, peaceful coexistence, and mutual respect among all communities. By promoting a more nuanced and contextual understanding of Islamic teachings and history, we can work towards fostering greater understanding, dialogue, and peaceful coexistence between all faiths and cultures."
