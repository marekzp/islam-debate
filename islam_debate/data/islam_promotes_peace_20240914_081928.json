      "for": "Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed colleagues, distinguished audience,\n\nI stand before you today to argue that Islam indeed promotes peace. This is not merely an opinion but a fact rooted deeply in the Quran, the sayings of the Prophet Muhammad (hadith), and the actions of Muslims throughout history.\n\nLet's begin with the primary source: the Quran. Allah says, \"And if two factions among the believers should fight, then make reconciliation between them.\" (Quran 49:9) This verse emphasizes peace and unity within the Muslim community. Moreover, the Quran commands Muslims to maintain justice and fairness in all their dealings:\n\n\"O you who have believed, be persistently standing firm for Allah, witnesses in equity, and do not let the hatred of a people prevent you from being just.\" (Quran 5:8)\n\nFurthermore, the Quran teaches Muslims to treat others with kindness and compassion. It says, \"And not equal are those who sit at home - excepting those who are disabled - with those who strive hard in the cause of Allah, neither spending nor fighting, except those whom Allah has justified.\" (Quran 4:95)\n\nNow let's consider the sayings of Prophet Muhammad. He said, \"A true Muslim is he from whose tongue and hand other Muslims are safe.\" (Bukhari) This emphasizes mutual respect and safety among Muslims.\n\nMoreover, Prophet Muhammad encouraged peace even in times of conflict. He said, \"The best amongst people are those who have the best manners and character.\" (Tirmidhi)\n\nHistory provides numerous examples of Islamic empires promoting peace and tolerance. During the period of Muslim rule in Spain, known as Al-Andalus, Muslims, Christians, and Jews coexisted relatively harmoniously, fostering a golden age of cultural advancement.\n\nIn conclusion, Islam promotes peace through its teachings, historical examples, and practical applications in daily life. We see this in the Quran's commandments, Prophet Muhammad's sayings, and the positive contributions made by Islamic societies throughout history.\n\nI look forward to discussing these points further and engaging with counterarguments during our debate today.\n\nThank you.\n\n**Relevant Citations:**\n\n1.

      "against": "Thank you, ladies and gentlemen of the audience, esteemed opponents, and moderator. I stand before you today to challenge the proposition that 'Islam promotes peace'. While it's important to note that many Muslims strive for peace and live by peaceful principles, I argue that the Quran, Hadith, and historical Islamic empires provide ample evidence that Islam has also promoted violence, conquest, and intolerance.\n\nFirstly, let's consider some verses from the Quran that advocate for violence against unbelievers:\n\n1. \"Fight and slay the pagans wherever ye find them, seize them, beleaguer them, and lie in wait for them by every stratagem...\" (Quran 9:5)\n2. \"When you encounter the disbelievers on the battlefield, do not turn your backs on them.\" (Quran 8:16)\n3. \"I will instill terror into the hearts of the unbelievers, so that they fight among themselves and every man turns to his own company.\" (Quran 59:13)\n\nThese verses are part of the Quran's violent verses, many of which were revealed in Medina during a time of war, and they have been used to justify violence against non-Muslims throughout history.\n\nSecondly, let's look at some Hadith that encourage violence:\n\n1. \"The Prophet said: 'Allah made me victorious by awe, for all my enemies were terrorized.' He then said: ' Except the Ethiopia because they had the virtue of religion (i.e., they were Christians).'\" (Sahih Muslim 4357)\n2. The Prophet Muhammad is reported to have said, \"Go forth in Allah's name and strive with yourselves and your wealth against those who disbelieve Allah.\" (Sahih Bukhari 2986)\n\nLastly, let's not forget the historical fact that Islamic empires expanded through conquests, forced conversions, and enslavement. The Ottoman Empire is a prime example of this, as it conquered vast territories from Eastern Europe to North Africa and the Middle East, often employing violent methods.\n\nIn conclusion, while there are peaceful verses in the Quran and many Muslims live by them, there are also numerous verses that promote violence and intolerance towards non-Muslims. History has shown us that Islamic empires have employed violent means to expand their territories. Therefore, it is not accurate to claim that 'Islam promotes peace'.\n\nI look forward to discussing these points further with my opponents and learning from each other throughout this debate.\n\nSources:\n- Quran translations: Pickthall and Shakir\n- Hadith collections: Sahih Bukhari and Sahih Muslim"

      "for": "Thank you for providing the opponent's arguments. I would like to address their points while reinforcing my stance that Islam promotes peace.\n\n1. **Verses of Violence:**\n\n   The verses quoted by the opponent are often taken out of context or misunderstood due to their historical and linguistic nuances. Let's examine them more closely:\n\n   a) Quran 9:5 (Pickthall) - \"Fight and slay the pagans wherever ye find them, seize them, beleaguer them, and lie in wait for them by every stratagem...\" This verse is part of a chapter revealed during a specific period of war. It was later abrogated by verses promoting peace and mercy (e.g., Quran 9:13-14). Moreover, the word \"pagans\" here refers to specific tribes that had broken treaties with Muslims at that time.\n\n   b) Quran 8:16 - This verse is about self-defense during wartime. It does not advocate offensive aggression against non-combatants or innocent people.\n\n   c) Quran 59:13 (Pickthall) - This verse is often misinterpreted. It actually means that Allah instills fear in the hearts of disbelievers so they fight each other, not Muslims. The phrase \"every man turns to his own company\" refers to disunity among disbelievers, not violence against Muslims.\n\n   **Relevant Citations:**\n   - Quran 9:13-14 (Pickthall) - https://quran.com/9/13-14\n   - Quran 2:190-194 (Pickthall) - https://quran.com/2/190-194 (these verses discuss just war and its conditions)\n\n2. **Hadith on Violence:**\n\n   The opponent quoted two Hadith out of context. Let's clarify them:\n\n   a) Sahih Muslim 4357 - This Hadith does not advocate terrorizing people based on their faith. It discusses the Prophet's awe-inspiring presence, which led people to accept Islam peacefully. The exception for Ethiopia is because they had the virtue of religion (i.e., they were Christians who did not oppose Muslims).\n\n   b) Sahih Bukhari 2986 - This Hadith encourages struggle (jihad) in the path of Allah, but it does not promote violence against non-Muslims. Jihad here refers to striving with oneself and one's wealth for righteous causes, including education, social welfare, and spiritual growth.\n\n   **Relevant Citations:**\n   - Sahih Muslim 4357 - https://sunnah.com/muslim/29/160\n   - Sahih Bukhari 2986 - https://sunnah.com/bukhari/67/6\n\n3. **Historical Context:**\n\n   It's essential to understand the historical context of Islamic empires. Many conquests were defensive or aimed at protecting Muslim communities from external aggression. Moreover, forced conversions and enslavement were practices not unique to Islamic empires but common among medieval societies worldwide.\n\n   The Ottoman Empire is often cited as an example of violent expansion. However, its history is complex and cannot be reduced solely to violence. It was also a period of cultural exchange, architectural marvels, and religious tolerance (e.g., the Millet system).\n\n   **Relevant Citations:**\n   - \"The Ottoman Empire and Its Muslim, Christian, and Jewish Subjects\" by Cornell H. Fleischer\n   - \"The Great Islamic Empires: From 1000 to 1750\" edited by Michael A. LeVan\n\nIn conclusion, the opponent's arguments cherry-pick verses and Hadith without proper context or understanding of their linguistic nuances. Islam promotes peace through its core teachings and historical examples, despite occasional misinterpretations and misuse of its texts.",
      "against": "Thank you for providing the opponent's response. I appreciate their efforts in trying to contextualize the violent verses and Hadith. However, my position remains that 'Islam promotes peace' is a misleading proposition due to the presence of violence-promoting texts and historical actions within Islamic teachings and empire-building. Here's how I respond to their arguments:\n\n1. **Recontextualizing Violent Verses:**\n\n   While it's true that the violent verses have contexts, they remain problematic due to their interpretations over time and continued usage by extremist groups. Let's examine the opponent's attempts at recontextualization:\n\n   a) Quran 9:5 - The opponent argues that this verse was abrogated by later verses promoting peace (Quran 9:13-14). However, even if we accept this interpretation, it doesn't change the fact that this violent verse exists and has been used to justify violence throughout history. Moreover, many Islamic scholars argue that this verse remains valid for its intended recipients, namely, specific pagan Arab tribes.\n\n   b) Quran 8:16 - The opponent claims this verse is about self-defense during wartime. However, its interpretation varies among Muslim scholars. Some interpret it as allowing offensive aggression against non-Muslims under certain conditions (e.g., Ibn Kathir's tafsir), while others view it strictly as defensive warfare.\n\n   c) Quran 59:13 - The opponent's explanation of this verse is convoluted and not supported by major translations or commentaries. The phrase \"every man turns to his own company\" (ya'lamu nafsahu bi-ma laysa lahu minhu) is generally understood as referring to Muslims turning away from disbelief towards faith, not disunity among disbelievers.\n\n   **Relevant Citations:**\n   - Quran 9:5 abrogation debate: https://www.islamicbulletin.com/forums/showthread.php?tid=26374\n   - Ibn Kathir's tafsir on Quran 8:16: http://justiceforall.ca/index.php?q=node/1029\n\n2. **Recontextualizing Hadith:**\n\n   The opponent attempts to soften the impact of the two violent Hadith by offering alternative interpretations:\n\n   a) Sahih Muslim 4357 - While it's true that this Hadith primarily discusses the Prophet's awe-inspiring presence, the phrase \"so fight and slay the pagans wherever ye find them\" (wa-qatil\u016bhum hayhun wa-\u2018aqir\u016bhum hayhun) remains problematic. Many translations and commentaries interpret this as encouraging violence against non-Muslims.\n\n   b) Sahih Bukhari 2986 - The opponent claims that jihad in this Hadith refers to striving with oneself and one's wealth for righteous causes. However, the phrase \"go forth... against those who disbelieve Allah\" (kh\u0101j\u016b... 'al\u0101 man dis\u0101 All\u0101h) is generally understood as encouraging armed struggle against non-Muslims.\n\n   **Relevant Citations:**\n   - Sahih Muslim 4357 translations: https://quran.ksu.edu/harun/quran.php?sura=9&verse=5\n   - Sahih Bukhari 2986 interpretations: http://www.searchtruth.com/searchResults.php?q=%22jihad%20nafasakh&b=and\n\n3. **Historical Context and Tolerance:**\n\n   The opponent argues that Islamic empires engaged in defensive conquests and had periods of religious tolerance. However, this overlooks the fact that many conquests were indeed offensive (e.g., the early Arab invasions into Persia and Byzantium), and religious tolerance was often conditional upon paying a tribute or converting to Islam.\n\n   Moreover, historical examples of tolerance do not negate the numerous incidents of violence and oppression throughout Islamic history. For instance, while the Ottoman Empire had periods of religious tolerance under the Millet system, it also committed atrocities such as the massacre of Christian minorities during the Conquest of Constantinople.\n\n   **Relevant Citations:**\n   - Offensive conquests: \"The Arab Conquest of Iran\" by Richard N. Frye\n   - Conditions for religious tolerance: http://www.islamicboard.com/showthread.php?t=256097\n   - Ottoman atrocities: https://www.britannica.com/event/conquest-of-constantinople\n\nIn conclusion, while the opponent's attempts at recontextualization are noteworthy, they do not absolve Islam from its violent verses and historical actions. The proposition 'Islam promotes peace' remains problematic due to the presence of violence-promoting texts and actions within Islamic teachings and empire-building."

      "for": "**Concluding Statement:**\n\nLadies and gentlemen, esteemed colleagues, and distinguished audience,\n\nWe have delved into the heart of Islam's teachings and history to address the question: does Islam promote peace? Throughout this debate, I have maintained that indeed it does, and my arguments have been bolstered by evidence from the Quran, Hadith, and historical context.\n\nFirstly, we examined the Quranic verses often cited as promoting violence. Through careful analysis, we found that these verses are either misunderstood due to linguistic nuances or taken out of their historical contexts. Many of them discuss self-defense during specific periods of war, while others have been abrogated by later verses emphasizing peace and mercy (e.g., Quran 2:190-194).\n\nSecondly, we addressed the opponent's arguments regarding certain Hadith that seem to advocate violence. Upon closer examination, however, these narratives were found to be misinterpreted or taken out of context. For instance, the Hadith about the Prophet's awe-inspiring presence (Sahih Muslim 4357) does not promote terrorizing people based on their faith, while another (Sahih Bukhari 2986) discusses struggle in the path of Allah but does not advocate violence against non-Muslims.\n\nLastly, we explored the historical context of Islamic empires. While it's undeniable that some conquests and practices were less than peaceful, it's essential to understand that these were products of their times and not reflective of Islam's core teachings. Many conquests were defensive in nature, and practices like forced conversions and enslavement were unfortunately common among medieval societies worldwide.\n\nIn light of these points, we must acknowledge that Islam promotes peace through its fundamental teachings:\n\n1. **The Oneness of Allah (Tawhid)**: This central belief fosters humility, patience, and tolerance towards all creation.\n2. **Prophetic Example**: The life and teachings of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) embody kindness, mercy, justice, and fairness towards all people.\n3. **Core Quranic Values**: Islam emphasizes peace, mercy, compassion, wisdom, and moderation throughout its holy book.\n4. **Historical Examples**: Throughout history, Muslims have made significant contributions to human civilization through advancements in science, philosophy, art, and culture, often done in the spirit of promoting harmony and understanding among diverse peoples.\n\nWhile we must acknowledge that interpretations and misuses of Islamic teachings can lead to violent outcomes, it is crucial not to conflate these aberrations with the true essence of Islam. The peaceful nature of Islam is evident in its foundational principles and historical examples.\n\nIn conclusion, I maintain my stance: **Islam promotes peace**. This understanding is supported by a comprehensive analysis of its sacred texts and a nuanced appreciation for their historical contexts. Let us strive to foster a deeper understanding of Islam that recognizes its inherently peaceful and tolerant nature, thereby promoting interfaith dialogue, cooperation, and harmony.\n\nThank you for your attention, and may Allah grant us all peace, understanding, and wisdom.",
      "against": "In conclusion, while the opponent has presented arguments attempting to contextualize violent verses in the Quran and Hadith, as well as highlighting periods of religious tolerance throughout Islamic history, these efforts do not fundamentally address the core issue: Islam contains texts that promote violence and has a historical record marked by conquests and oppression. The proposition 'Islam promotes peace' is therefore misleading, given the existence of these problematic elements within Islamic teachings and empire-building.\n\nMy position remains that we must acknowledge the complexity of Islamic history and interpretations, recognizing both its peaceful aspects and its violent ones. To truly understand Islam's role in promoting peace, we must engage openly with its textual controversies and historical actions, rather than brushing them aside or oversimplifying them. Only then can we foster a nuanced understanding of Islam that respects its complexity and addresses its challenges head-on.\n\nBy engaging in this debate, I have aimed to shed light on these complexities, hoping to encourage further dialogue and critical examination of Islamic texts and history. Let us continue to explore these topics with open minds, seeking not to condemn or defend Islam in its entirety, but to understand it in all its multifaceted glory and contradiction."
