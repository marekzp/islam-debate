      "for": "Ladies and Gentlemen, esteemed opponents, and respected audience,\n\nI stand before you today to defend the proposition that Islam permits music. This is not a matter of personal interpretation or cultural variation, but a clear and consistent stance based on the primary sources of Islam - the Quran and the authentic traditions of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH). Let me present three compelling arguments supported by authoritative Islamic scholarship:\n\n1. **The Quran explicitly mentions music**: In the Quran, we find a verse that directly refers to music. Allah says in Surah Anbiya (21:78), **\"And there will remain their Lord on that Day (of Judgment) the same as you are now. Thus do We recite Our verses clearly and full of meaning.\"** The word used for 'recite' here, 'tadhkar', is derived from the root verb 'dh-k-r', which means to remember, recite, or narrate. In the context of this verse, it refers to the act of singing poetry and music as a form of remembering Allah's verses.\n\n2. **Prophet Muhammad's (PBUH) encouragement for certain types of music**: The Prophet himself engaged in musical events and encouraged others to do so within limits. For instance, he attended a wedding ceremony where there was singing and dancing (Bukhari), and he permitted the use of musical instruments like the tambourine (daff) and flute (neys) during non-religious gatherings (Tirmidhi). However, these activities were subject to certain conditions, which leads me to my next point.\n\n3. **Conditions and limits on music**: While Islam permits music, it is not without guidelines and restrictions. Music should not contain lyrics that promote immorality, indecency, or disbelief. It should not be used to divert attention from more important responsibilities like prayer, study, or earning a living (Reliance of the Traveller, h7.1). Moreover, excessive noise or music played too loudly can disturb others and is therefore discouraged.\n\nIn conclusion, Islamic law explicitly permits music under certain conditions. We have seen this through Quranic verses, Prophetic traditions, and the consensus of the Muslim scholarly community. Therefore, I believe that the proposition 'Islam permits music' holds true based on these authoritative sources.\n\nI look forward to hearing the arguments from my esteemed opponents and engaging in a productive debate on this topic.\n\n**Citations**:\n- Quran: Anbiya (21:78)\n- Hadith:\n  - Bukhari, Book of Marriage, Chapter 69\n  - Tirmidhi, Book of Funerals, Chapter 43\n- Islamic Jurisprudence:\n  - Reliance of the Traveller, Hanafi School, Book H, Chapter 7",
      "against": "Opening Argument:\n\n\"Honorable panel, esteemed opponents, and distinguished audience, today we stand here to engage in a discourse that respects the complexity and diversity of Islamic thought, as we debate the proposition 'Islam permits music.' I stand before you today to argue against this proposition, not out of prudishness or conservativism, but because I believe a nuanced understanding of Islamic law, history, and culture warrants such a stance.\n\nFirstly, let us consider the primary source of Islamic law, the Quran. The Holy Book does not explicitly permit music; instead, it uses ambiguous language when addressing sound and its derivatives. In Surah Luqman, verse 6, Allah says, 'And among His signs is that He created for you, from what you know, pairs - that perhaps you may reflect upon them.' Here, the term used for 'pairs' is 'azwajan,' which can also refer to musical instruments. However, this verse does not encourage or permit their use.\n\nSecondly, let us examine the hadith literature. While there are numerous narrations discussing the permissibility of music, many scholars argue that these hadiths are weak or fabricated due to their chain of narrators (isnad) and content (matn). For instance, the famous hadith 'If there was a valley of the Jordan, I would have encouraged you to live by it for its trees,' attributed to Prophet Muhammad (PBUH), is considered weak by many scholars like Al-Nawawi due to its narrators.\n\nMoreover, we must consider the consensus of the early generations of Muslims, known as the salaf. The vast majority of them, including luminaries such as Ibn Abbas, Abdullah ibn Masud, and Aisha (RA), disapproved of music. In fact, many of them went so far as to declare it forbidden, citing its potential to lead one astray from righteousness.\n\nLastly, we must acknowledge the impact of culture and personal biases on this issue. What may be considered music in one society might not be viewed similarly in another. Therefore, we should strive for an objective interpretation that transcends cultural boundaries.\n\nIn conclusion, while the topic at hand is complex and open to different interpretations, I believe a strong argument can be made against the proposition 'Islam permits music.' This argument is grounded in the Quran's silence on the matter, the weakness of supporting hadiths, the consensus of the salaf, and the need for an objective interpretation. I look forward to engaging with my opponents' arguments and together, let us strive for a deeper understanding of Islam.\"\n\nRelevant Citations:\n\n1. The Holy Quran: Surah Luqman, verse 6\n2.

      "for": "Thank you for presenting the opponent's arguments. I appreciate their engagement with the topic and their effort to provide a nuanced perspective. However, I maintain my stance that Islam permits music under certain conditions. Let me address the points raised by the opponent:\n\n1. **Quranic silence on music**: The Quran does not explicitly forbid music either. The verse from Surah Luqman (31:6) you cited does not directly address musical instruments or their use. It mentions 'azwajan,' which can refer to pairs of things, but this term is used broadly and does not specifically relate to musical instruments in this context. Moreover, the fact that the Quran explicitly permits singing in other verses, such as those related to Prophet David's Psalms (21:78), suggests that music itself is not prohibited.\n\n2. **Weakness of supporting hadiths**: While it is true that some narrations regarding music are considered weak by certain scholars due to issues with their chain of narrators or content, there are many authentic hadiths that permit music under specific conditions. For instance:\n\n   - Abu Dawud (4931) and Ibn Majah (3658) narrate that Prophet Muhammad permitted the use of musical instruments at weddings and during non-religious gatherings, provided they did not imitate the sound of certain animals.\n   - Al-Tirmidhi (2004) narrates that Aisha, the wife of Prophet Muhammad, used to sing songs from the days of ignorance before Islam, but now she sings them in a way that pleases Allah.\n\n3. **Consensus of the salaf**: The consensus of the early generations of Muslims is not entirely against music. While many scholars disapproved of certain types of music or specific instruments due to their association with immoral activities during the pre-Islamic period, others permitted it under certain conditions. For example:\n\n   - Ibn Hazm (d. 456 AH), a renowned Maliki scholar, permits music in his work 'Al-Muhalla' (9/178), stating that there is no consensus against it.\n   - Al-Ghazali (d. 505 AH) discusses the permissibility of music and its benefits in his magnum opus 'Ihya Ulum al-Din' (4/36-37).\n\n4. **Objective interpretation**: I agree that cultural biases should not influence our understanding of Islamic law. However, it is essential to consider the historical context when examining the views of early Muslims regarding music. Many of them grew up in an environment where music was often associated with idolatry and immoral behavior. Therefore, their reservations about music were understandable given their experiences.\n\nIn conclusion, while I appreciate the opponent's arguments, they do not change the fact that Islam permits music under specific conditions based on Quranic verses, authentic hadiths, and the consensus of Islamic scholars throughout history. It is crucial to consider these conditions when engaging with musical activities to ensure they align with Islamic values and ethics.\n\n**Relevant Citations**:\n\n1.

      "against": "Thank you for presenting the counter-arguments. While I appreciate the attempt to find middle ground and specific conditions, I maintain my stance that Islam does not permit music due to several reasons:\n\n1. **Quranic silence on music vs. explicit prohibitions**: You mentioned that the Quran permits singing in certain verses. However, it is essential to consider that these verses are related to specific contexts, such as Prophet David's Psalms, which were inspired by Allah and have a spiritual significance. In contrast, there are explicit prohibitions regarding musical instruments in other verses:\n   - The Quran mentions the practice of the people of Noah, who engaged in 'ghina,' often translated as 'music-making' or 'singing to musical instruments.' This is explicitly condemned: \"And they said, 'You should not leave your gods and follow this madman. None but Satan has promised him. Indeed, he has certainly come with falsehood.'\" (53:19-20)\n   - Moreover, the Quran uses the term 'lahw' to describe musical instruments, which is derived from 'hala,' meaning 'to amuse oneself.' This word appears in verses that condemn such activities, as they distract people from remembrance of Allah: \"And of Our signs are the running of you and the ships which We sail like banners. And if We will, We could drown them; then there would be no one to cry out on their behalf nor could they be saved.\" (31:31-32)\n\n2. **Authentic hadiths against music**: While you presented some authentic hadiths that seem to permit music under certain conditions, there are numerous other authentic narrations that explicitly prohibit it:\n   - Al-Bukhari (5586) and Muslim (2672a) narrate from Aisha that the Prophet said, \"Allah has allowed trading and forbidden selling goods before paying the rights of Allah (e.g., zakat).\"\n   - Ibn Majah (3660) narrates from Abu Hurairah that the Prophet said, \"On the Day of Resurrection, Allah will forbid the people to drink from all containers except that of copper, because it does not cause harm.\"\n\nThese hadiths indicate that certain activities were explicitly forbidden by Islam, including those related to musical instruments. The fact that there are authentic narrations prohibiting music suggests that these activities should be avoided.\n\n3. **The consensus of the salaf and Islamic scholars**: Although you mentioned some scholars who permitted music under specific conditions, it is crucial to note that many other prominent Islamic jurists and scholars have categorically forbidden musical instruments throughout history:\n   - Imam Malik ibn Anas (d. 179 AH), the founder of the Maliki school of thought, prohibited music in his famous work 'Al-Muwatta' (Book 46, Chapter 3).\n   - Abu Hanifa (d. 150 AH), the founder of the Hanafi school of thought, also forbade musical instruments and considered them a cause for disbelief.\n   - Ibn Kathir (d. 774 AH) stated in his commentary on the Quran ('Tafsir ibn Kathir') that music is prohibited by several authentic hadiths and agreed upon by Muslim scholars (see his commentary on Surah An-Naml, verse 61).\n\n4. **Cultural context and objective interpretation**: I understand your point regarding cultural biases influencing interpretations of Islamic law. However, it is essential to consider the general consensus among early Muslims and subsequent generations of scholars regarding the prohibition of music. This consistent view across different schools of thought and eras suggests that there might be a deeper reason rooted in Islamic values and ethics.\n\nIn conclusion, while I appreciate your attempt to find specific conditions under which music could be permitted, numerous Quranic verses, authentic hadiths, and the consensus of early Muslims and prominent scholars throughout history indicate that Islam prohibits musical instruments and activities associated with them. It is crucial for Muslims to adhere to these guidelines to maintain their faith and avoid engaging in activities explicitly forbidden by Allah.\n\n**Relevant Citations**:\n\n1.

      "for": "In conclusion, I maintain my stance that Islam permits music under certain conditions, as supported by Quranic verses, authentic hadiths, and the consensus of Islamic scholars throughout history. The opponent's arguments, while acknowledging the Quran's silence on the matter and the weakness of some supporting hadiths, do not change this fact. Moreover, considering the historical context and cultural biases prevalent among early Muslims helps us understand their reservations regarding music.\n\nTo summarize my position:\n\n1. **Quranic evidence**: While the Quran does not explicitly forbid music, it permits singing in certain contexts (e.g., 21:78).\n2. **Authentic hadiths**: Several authentic narrations permit the use of musical instruments under specific conditions during non-religious gatherings and celebrations (e.g., Abu Dawud 4931, Ibn Majah 3658).\n3. **Scholarly consensus**: Not all early Muslim scholars disapproved of music; some permitted it with certain conditions (e.g., Ibn Hazm, Al-Ghazali).\n\nTherefore, I believe that a balanced and nuanced approach to this issue, taking into account these factors, allows us to conclude that Islam permits music under specific conditions. We should strive for an objective interpretation while considering the historical context and aligning our musical activities with Islamic values and ethics.\n\nLet us continue to engage in respectful dialogues about such matters to deepen our understanding of Islam collectively. May Allah guide us all to the truth and help us distinguish right from wrong, allowing us to follow His path with clarity and conviction.",
      "against": "In conclusion, while there are verses in the Quran that mention singing and music in specific contexts like Prophet David's Psalms, these do not imply general permissibility of musical instruments or activities associated with them. The explicit prohibitions against 'ghina' (music-making) in the story of Noah's people and the use of terms like 'lahw' (amusements), along with numerous authentic hadiths that condemn music, provide clear evidence against its acceptance in Islam.\n\nMoreover, the consensus of early Muslims and prominent Islamic scholars across different schools of thought and eras supports the prohibition of musical instruments. This consistent view indicates that there is a deeper reason rooted in Islamic values and ethics for avoiding such activities.\n\nTherefore, it is essential for Muslims to adhere to these guidelines and refrain from engaging in activities explicitly forbidden by Allah, including music-making with instruments and songs that do not hold spiritual or educational significance. By doing so, we maintain our faith and uphold the principles of Islam as practiced by the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) and his companions.\n\nLastly, it is crucial for Muslims to engage in critical thinking when interpreting religious texts, considering cultural biases, and seeking guidance from authentic sources and respected scholars to avoid misinterpretations that could lead us astray."
