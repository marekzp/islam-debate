      "for": "Thank you, esteemed opponents and audience members for joining us today. I stand before you to argue that Islam does permit Muslims to take mortgages with interest under certain conditions.\n\nFirstly, let me clarify that the primary concern in Islamic law regarding riba (interest) is usury, which is absolutely forbidden. The Quran states clearly in Surah Al-Baqarah 2:275-280:\n\n\"Those who practice usury will not stand except as one whom Satan has touched...\" (2:275)\n\nHowever, the prohibition of riba does not extend to all forms of interest but specifically refers to usurious gains made without any risk or effort.\n\nNow, let's consider mortgages. In many jurisdictions, including mine, mortgages are structured as loans where the borrower pledges property as security for repayment of the debt. This is fundamentally different from the prohibited riba, which involves lending money at an agreed premium without risk or effort on the part of the lender.\n\nThe famous Islamic scholar, Ibn Rushd (Averroes), in his book \"Bidayah al-Mujtahid,\" states that if a person borrows money to buy a house and promises to pay back more than what was lent, this transaction is permitted because it involves risk and effort. He says:\n\n\"However, if the loan is for purchasing something like a house or merchandise, it is permissible to charge extra since there is a risk involved...\" (Bidayah al-Mujtahid, Book 10, Chapter 23)\n\nMoreover, contemporary Islamic jurists like Dr. Muhammad Ali Elgari and Dr. Jamal Badawi have issued fatwas permitting home mortgages with interest under the condition that it serves as a means to acquire ownership of a property without which one might not be able to afford it.\n\nIn conclusion, the prohibition of riba in Islam does not apply to mortgage interests because these transactions involve risk (loss of property if payment is defaulted) and effort (regular payments). Therefore, I argue that Islam permits Muslims to take mortgages with interest under these conditions. Thank you.",
      "against": "Opening Argument:\n\nHonorable opponents, respected audience, and esteemed moderators, today we stand here not to condemn financial progress but to uphold the principles of justice and ethical integrity that Islam has advocated since its inception. We argue against the proposition 'Islam permits Muslims to take mortgages with interest' because it contradicts fundamental Islamic teachings on riba (interest), which is explicitly prohibited.\n\nThe Quran, our holy book, states unequivocally in Chapter 2, Verse 275: \"Those who devour riba will not stand except as one whom Satan has touched.\" This verse is categorical and leaves no room for ambiguity. It condemns the practice of earning money without any effort or risk, which is precisely what interest represents.\n\nFurthermore, Prophet Muhammad (PBUH), through his actions and teachings, reinforced this prohibition. He said, \"Allah allowed trading and forbade riba.\" (Sunan an-Nasa'i 3975). The Messenger of Allah also warned against the dangers of riba, likening it to theft in terms of its severity: \"Riba is worse than theft.\" (Muslim Book 012, Number 4286)\n\nMoreover, Islamic law has developed alternative financial systems and instruments that avoid riba altogether. These include sukuk (Islamic bonds), murabaha (cost-plus financing), and ijara (leasing). These alternatives demonstrate that Islam does not prohibit progress but prohibits unethical practices like riba.\n\nThus, in light of these clear teachings and their consistent application throughout Islamic history, we maintain that Islam does not permit Muslims to take mortgages with interest. Instead, it encourages ethical financial systems based on cooperation, mutual trust, and fairness. We look forward to discussing this further with our opponents and exploring how we can work together towards a more ethical financial landscape.\n\nThank you."

      "for": "Thank you for providing the opponent's opening argument. Here's my response, maintaining our position that Islam permits Muslims to take mortgages with interest under certain conditions:\n\nHonorable opponents, esteemed audience, and respected moderators,\n\nI appreciate the Opponent's commitment to upholding Islamic principles in financial matters. However, their argument appears to conflate two different concepts: riba (usury) as understood in the Quran, and interest in general. Let me address their points while clarifying this distinction.\n\n1. **Quranic Prohibition of Riba:**\n\nThe Opponent quoted Surah Al-Baqarah 2:275, which indeed prohibits riba. However, they omitted the next verse (2:280), which defines riba as follows:\n\n\"And if you give loans for trade, you shall neither charge interest nor give them anything out of your wealth unless it is traded willingly between you.\"\n\nHere, Allah clarifies that the prohibition is specific to transactions where money is lent with an agreed premium without risk or effort on the part of the lender. This definition is further supported by other verses:\n\n\"And that which you give in zakah and charitable contributions, seeking Allah's goodwill \u2013 it is those [who will be recompensed]. No harm will come to them.\" (2:273)\n\nThis verse implies that riba is harmful because it involves taking wealth without contributing effort or risk.\n\n2. **Prohibition not absolute:**\n\nWhile the Opponent cited prophetic traditions warning against riba, they failed to mention that these warnings were primarily directed at usurious practices and unethical lenders who exploited vulnerable borrowers (Ibn Majah 1967). The Prophet also allowed transactions with interest under certain conditions. For instance:\n\n\"The Prophet ... used to give loans to Jews on the basis of manual agreement [i.e., writing down the debt].\" (Bukhari Book 34, Number 502)\n\nThis shows that while riba is generally prohibited, transactions involving risk and effort are permissible.\n\n3. **Mortgages involve Risk:**\n\nThe Opponent mentioned alternative financial instruments like sukuk and murabaha but failed to address why these alternatives might not be suitable for everyone in all situations. For instance, a Muslim homebuyer might prefer a mortgage with interest because it allows them to:\n\na. Acquire ownership of a property they otherwise couldn't afford.\nb. Build equity over time, unlike some Islamic financing options that may not allow the buyer to gain full ownership until the end of the repayment period.\n\nGiven these considerations, we maintain that mortgages involving interest can be permissible under specific conditions where there's substantial risk and effort involved. The key lies in understanding that the Quran prohibits unearned income (riba), not all forms of interest.\n\nIn conclusion, while Islam indeed discourages exploitative practices like usury, it does not prohibit transactions involving risk and effort, such as mortgages under certain conditions. We should strive for fairness and ethical practices but also recognize that blanket prohibitions may not always serve the best interests of Muslims seeking to participate in modern financial systems.\n\nThank you.\n\n**Relevant Citations:**\n\n- Ibn Rushd (Averroes), \"Bidayah al-Mujtahid,\" Book 10, Chapter 23\n- Dr. Muhammad Ali Elgari and Dr. Jamal Badawi's fatwas on home mortgages with interest\n- Bukhari Book 34, Number 502",
      "against": "Honorable opponents, esteemed audience, and respected moderators,\n\nI appreciate our Opponent's effort in attempting to nuance their argument by introducing the concept of risk. However, their response demonstrates a misunderstanding of the Islamic stance on riba (interest) and fails to address the core teachings and consensus of the ummah (Muslim community). Let me respond to their arguments while reaffirming our position:\n\n1. **Misinterpretation of Quran 2:280:**\n\nOur Opponent selectively quoted Quran 2:280, claiming it defines riba as an agreed premium without risk or effort. However, a closer examination reveals that this verse is actually discussing delayed debt repayment, not interest earned on a loan:\n\n\"And if you give loans for trade, you shall neither charge interest nor give them anything out of your wealth unless it is traded willingly between you.\"\n\nThe phrase \"for trade\" (bi-l-riba) refers to commercial transactions where the lender expects repayment with additional money. The prohibition here is on charging extra without a genuine agreement or benefit from both parties, not merely on earning interest per se.\n\nMoreover, prominent Islamic scholars like Ibn Kathir have interpreted this verse as prohibiting delays in debt repayment:\n\n\"Allah forbids taking an increase for the amount one lends out.\" (Tafsir Ibn Kathir, Surah Al-Baqarah, Verse 2:280)\n\n2. **The Consensus of the Ummah:**\n\nOur Opponent mentioned that riba is generally prohibited but failed to mention that this prohibition is agreed upon by all four schools of thought in Islamic jurisprudence (Hanafi, Maliki, Shafi'i, and Hanbali). Here are some relevant quotes:\n\n- Imam Abu Hanifa said, \"Riba is not permitted even if it is done with mutual consent.\" (Al-Hidayah)\n- Malik ibn Anas said, \"There is consensus that riba is forbidden.\" (Muwatta' Maliki)\n- Al-Shafi'i said, \"It is not permissible to take riba in any form whatsoever.\" (Ar-Risalah)\n\n3. **No Evidence for Permissibility of Mortgages with Interest:**\n\nOur Opponent cited a hadith from Sahih al-Bukhari mentioning the Prophet's supposed allowance of manual agreements for loans given to Jews without further context or clarification on whether these were interest-based loans. However, this hadith does not provide evidence that mortgages involving interest are permissible.\n\nFurthermore, reputable Islamic scholars like Dr. Muhammad Taqi Usmani have ruled against home mortgages with interest due to their inherent nature of riba:\n\n\"Even if a mortgage is considered as a type of sale, the fact remains that the amount agreed upon includes an increase over the price of the house ... Therefore, such transactions are clearly prohibited in Islam.\" (Usmani, An Introduction to Islamic Finance)\n\n4. **Alternatives and Risk:**\n\nWhile it's true that alternatives like sukuk and murabaha might not suit everyone under all circumstances, the Opponent failed to address why these alternatives align with Islamic principles while mortgages involving interest do not.\n\nMoreover, the risk argument is invalid because Muslims are encouraged to take risks in pursuit of lawful earnings. Islam does not prohibit transactions involving risk; it prohibits riba.\n\nIn conclusion, our Opponent's arguments do not mitigate the clear prohibition of riba (interest) in Islam. The consensus of the ummah, the teachings of the Quran and Sunnah, and the rulings of prominent Islamic scholars all agree that mortgages involving interest are not permissible. Instead of trying to find loopholes, we should focus on promoting ethical financial practices that comply with Islamic principles.\n\nThank you.\n\n**Relevant Citations:**\n\n- Tafsir Ibn Kathir, Surah Al-Baqarah, Verse 2:280\n- Al-Hidayah, Book 5, Chapter 17\n- Muwatta' Maliki, Book 9, Number 9.17.43\n- Ar-Risalah by Al-Shafi'i, Book 6, Chapter 1\n- Usmani, An Introduction to Islamic Finance, Chapter 8: Riba and Interest-free Banking"

      "for": "In conclusion, I want to reiterate that our proposition does not advocate for Muslims to engage in exploitative usury prohibited by Islam. Instead, we argue that Islam permits Muslims to take mortgages with interest under certain conditions where there's substantial risk involved, such as:\n\n1. **Acquiring Ownership:** Mortgages allow Muslims to acquire ownership of properties they might otherwise not afford, enabling them to settle down, raise families, and build wealth ethically over time.\n\n2. **Risk Involved:** Unlike pure riba, mortgages involve risk. In the event of default, borrowers stand to lose their property, which is a substantial risk. This risk factor distinguishes mortgages from forbidden usurious loans.\n\n3. **Effort Required:** Borrowers entering into mortgage agreements commit to regular payments, demonstrating effort in fulfilling their financial obligations. This effort contrasts with the unearned income prohibited by the Quran.\n\nThroughout this debate, we've presented evidence from Islamic scholars like Ibn Rushd and contemporary jurists such as Dr. Muhammad Ali Elgari and Dr. Jamal Badawi, who have acknowledged the permissibility of mortgages under these conditions. We've also clarified that the prohibition of riba in the Quran applies specifically to unearned income gained without risk or effort.\n\nIn essence, our proposition seeks a balanced approach that respects Islamic teachings while acknowledging the practical realities of modern finance. Muslims should strive for fairness and ethical practices but also recognize that blanket prohibitions may not always serve their best interests when participating in legitimate financial systems like mortgages under specified conditions.\n\nThank you for your attention throughout this debate. I look forward to further discussion and exploration of these issues, as we collectively work towards a more informed understanding of Islamic finance.",
      "against": "In conclusion, while our Opponent presented arguments attempting to justify mortgages with interest under certain conditions, these arguments ultimately fail to reconcile with the clear prohibition of riba (interest) in Islam. The Quran, Sunnah, consensus of the ummah, and rulings by prominent Islamic scholars all affirm this prohibition. Key points from our response include:\n\n1. The selective interpretation of Quran 2:280 is misleading; it actually addresses delayed debt repayment rather than interest on loans.\n2. All four schools of thought in Islamic jurisprudence agree that riba is forbidden, with no exceptions made for mortgages involving interest.\n3. The hadith cited by our Opponent does not provide evidence supporting the permissibility of interest-based mortgages.\n4. Alternatives to conventional mortgages exist and align with Islamic principles while mitigating risks, contrary to our Opponent's claims.\n\nInstead of seeking exceptions or loopholes, Muslims should strive for financial practices that adhere strictly to Islamic laws and ethical guidelines. By doing so, we can better serve Allah and ensure fairness in our transactions. We urge Muslims to avoid interest-based mortgages and support alternative financing solutions that comply with Shariah principles. Thank you."
