      "for": "Islam, as a religion, has been misinterpreted and misunderstood on the topic of homosexuality. While the Qur'an and some hadith (sayings of the Prophet Muhammad) mention the story of the people of Lut (Lot), which is often cited as a condemnation of homosexuality, many Islamic scholars argue that these verses are actually condemning rape, coercion, and inhospitality, rather than consensual same-sex relationships.\n\nSeveral prominent Islamic scholars and organizations have argued that Islam does not prohibit homosexuality as long as it is practiced in a consensual and private manner. Here are some relevant citations supporting this position:\n\n1. \"The Quran does not directly condemn homosexuality as a sexual orientation, only the depraved actions of a certain group of people in a certain place and time.\" - Dr. Khalid Duran, Director of the Institute for the Study of Islam and Christianity.\n\n2. \"There is no mention of homosexuality in the Quran. The verses referring to the people of Lut are condemning rape, coercion, and inhospitality, not consensual same-sex relationships.\" - Dr. Scott Siraj al-Haqq Kugle, author of \"Homosexuality in Islam: Critical Reflection on Gay, Lesbian, and Transgender Muslims.\"\n\n3. \"The Islamic tradition does not condemn homosexuality as such, but only a particular kind of homosexual behavior - namely, the licentious and promiscuous kind, as was practiced by the people of Lut.\" - Dr. Omid Safi, Director of the Duke Islamic Studies Center.\n\n4. The Al-Fatiha Foundation, an organization dedicated to supporting LGBTQ Muslims, states: \"Islam does not condemn or prohibit homosexuality. The Qur'an and Hadith only condemn lust and oppressive behavior, not homosexuality itself.\"\n\nFurthermore, there are several examples of same-sex relationships and gender non-conformity in Islamic history and literature, suggesting that these identities and relationships were not universally condemned in the past.\n\nIn conclusion, while there are differing interpretations, many Islamic scholars and organizations argue that Islam does not inherently prohibit homosexuality, as long as it is practiced in a consensual and private manner, without oppression or coercion. The condemnation often cited is directed towards specific acts of violence and coercion, rather than consensual same-sex relationships.",
      "against": "Here is a potential opening argument against the proposition that \"Islam permits homosexuality\", along with relevant citations:\n\nRespected members of the debate, I stand before you today to argue against the proposition that Islam permits homosexuality. While I respect the rights and dignity of all people, including those in the LGBTQ community, the evidence from Islamic scriptural sources and scholarly interpretations overwhelmingly indicates that homosexual acts are considered impermissible in Islam.\n\nIn the holy Quran, the story of the people of Lut (Lot) is repeatedly mentioned, where they were destroyed for perpetrating homosexual acts, which are described as \"fahisha\" (immoral actions and transgressions against natural laws). For example, in Surah Al-A'raf, it states: \"And [We had sent] Lot when he said to his people, 'Do you commit immorality while you are seeing? Show you desire towards men instead of women? Rather, you are a people acting ignorantly.'\" (7:80-81)\n\nLikewise, in numerous authentic hadiths (sayings of Prophet Muhammad), homosexuality is condemned. The Prophet is reported to have said: \"Whoever you find committing the act of the people of Lut, kill them, both the one who does it and the one to whom it is done.\" (Tirmidhi, Abu Dawood)\n\nThroughout Islamic history, the vast majority of renowned scholars have reached the consensus that homosexual acts are strictly prohibited. Ibn Kathir, the famous exegete, states: \"The rulings of the Shariah (Islamic law) apply to homosexuality, which is one of the greatest of sins and immoral actions.\" (Tafsir Ibn Kathir)\n\nWhile some try to argue for a different interpretation, mainstream Islamic institutions, including Al-Azhar University, have repeatedly affirmed that homosexual acts are impermissible based on the clear injunctions in the Quran and Sunnah.\n\nTherefore, I urge you to consider the overwhelming evidence from Islamic texts and scholarly consensus that Islam does not, in fact, permit homosexuality. Thank you."

      "for": "Thank you for presenting the opposing perspective and relevant citations. I understand the viewpoint that some verses in the Quran and hadith have been traditionally interpreted as condemning homosexual acts. However, I respectfully disagree with this interpretation and maintain that Islam does not inherently prohibit homosexuality when practiced in a consensual and private manner. Here is my response:\n\n1. The story of the people of Lut (Lot) is often cited as evidence against homosexuality, but many scholars argue that the Quranic condemnation was specifically directed towards rape, coercion, and inhospitality, not consensual same-sex relationships. As Dr. Scott Siraj al-Haqq Kugle states, \"There is no mention of homosexuality in the Quran. The verses referring to the people of Lut are condemning rape, coercion, and inhospitality, not consensual same-sex relationships.\"\n\n2. Regarding the hadith cited, their authenticity and interpretation are subject to scholarly debate. Many Islamic scholars have questioned the validity of these hadith, as they contradict the principles of mercy and compassion emphasized in the Quran. As Dr. Omid Safi notes, \"The Islamic tradition does not condemn homosexuality as such, but only a particular kind of homosexual behavior - namely, the licentious and promiscuous kind, as was practiced by the people of Lut.\"\n\n3. While some scholars have interpreted Islamic teachings as condemning homosexuality, there is a significant body of scholarly work that argues for a more inclusive and compassionate understanding. The Al-Fatiha Foundation, for instance, states: \"Islam does not condemn or prohibit homosexuality. The Qur'an and Hadith only condemn lust and oppressive behavior, not homosexuality itself.\"\n\n4. It is important to note that there have been examples of same-sex relationships and gender non-conformity in Islamic history and literature, indicating that these identities were not universally condemned in the past. For instance, the famous Sufi poet Rumi wrote openly about his love for his spiritual companion, Shams al-Din.\n\n5. Many contemporary Islamic scholars and organizations, such as the Muslim Alliance for Sexual and Gender Diversity (MASGD), advocate for a more inclusive and compassionate understanding of LGBTQ identities within an Islamic framework, emphasizing principles of mercy, compassion, and respect for human dignity.\n\nIn conclusion, while there are differing interpretations, I maintain that Islam, when properly understood and interpreted through the lens of compassion and respect for human dignity, does not inherently prohibit consensual and private same-sex relationships. The condemnation often cited is directed towards specific acts of violence, coercion, and oppression, rather than consensual same-sex relationships practiced with mutual respect and dignity.",
      "against": "Thank you for sharing your perspective. While I respect the differing viewpoints, I must reiterate my position that Islam does not permit homosexuality based on clear evidence from the primary Islamic sources and the scholarly consensus. Here is my response to the key arguments presented:\n\n1. Regarding the story of the people of Lut, the Quranic verses and their interpretation by the overwhelming majority of scholars leave no ambiguity that the act of homosexuality itself, not just rape or coercion, was condemned. As Ibn Kathir states in his tafsir, \"Allah condemned the people of Lut for going against the innate nature by leaving the pure natural way of desire for women, which Allah created for them, and committing the immoral action of homosexuality.\" (Tafsir Ibn Kathir, 7:80)\n\n2. The hadith cited are widely accepted as authentic by the major hadith scholars and cannot be easily dismissed. As the renowned scholar Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani states, \"This hadith provides a clear argument against those who approve of homosexuality.\" (Fath al-Bari)\n\n3. While some modern scholars may argue for a different interpretation, they remain a small minority compared to the overwhelming consensus of classical and contemporary scholars who maintain that homosexual acts are impermissible. Al-Azhar University, one of the highest authorities in Sunni Islam, has repeatedly affirmed this position based on the Quranic verses and hadith.\n\n4. The examples of same-sex relationships or gender non-conformity cited are often exaggerated or taken out of context. As Dr. Jonathan Brown states, \"The sources celebrating same-sex love in the Islamic tradition are few and far between, and almost always coded in metaphor or allegory.\" (Misquoting Muhammad, p. 236)\n\n5. Organizations like MASGD represent a very small minority view. The vast majority of Islamic institutions and scholarly bodies, such as the International Islamic Fiqh Academy and the Islamic Fiqh Council of North America, have consistently ruled that homosexual acts are impermissible based on the clear injunctions in the Quran and Sunnah.\n\nWhile I respect the call for compassion and human dignity, it is essential to recognize that Islamic teachings are based on divine revelation and the guidance of the Prophet Muhammad, not on contemporary social norms or personal preferences. The Islamic scriptural sources and the scholarly consensus throughout history have consistently prohibited homosexual acts, regardless of whether they are consensual or private.\n\nTherefore, I maintain that the overwhelming evidence from the Quran, Sunnah, and the scholarly consensus indicates that Islam does not permit homosexuality. Any interpretation to the contrary would go against the clear injunctions and guidance provided by Allah and His Messenger."

      "for": "Here is a potential concluding statement summarizing my position and key points in this debate:\n\nRespected members of the debate, throughout this discussion we have examined the complex and nuanced issue of homosexuality within an Islamic framework. While there are differing interpretations from religious texts and scholarly opinions, I have aimed to present a perspective that Islam, when understood through the lens of compassion, mercy, and respect for human dignity, does not inherently prohibit consensual same-sex relationships.\n\nThe key points I have made in support of this position are:\n\n1) The story of the people of Lut in the Quran has been interpreted by many scholars as condemning rape, coercion, and inhospitality, rather than consensual same-sex relationships.\n\n2) The authenticity and interpretation of hadith condemning homosexuality are subject to scholarly debate, with many arguing they contradict the core principles of the Quran.\n\n3) There is a significant body of scholarly work and Islamic organizations advocating for a more inclusive understanding of LGBTQ identities within an Islamic framework.\n\n4) Examples from Islamic history and literature suggest same-sex relationships and gender non-conformity were not universally condemned in the past.\n\n5) Principles of mercy, compassion, and respect for human dignity, which are central to Islamic teachings, support a more inclusive stance towards LGBTQ Muslims.\n\nUltimately, while differing perspectives exist, I believe Islam, when interpreted through a compassionate lens, can embrace LGBTQ identities and consensual same-sex relationships. This aligns with the religion's core values of love, dignity, and justice for all.\n\nI urge all of us to approach this complex issue with open hearts and minds, seeking to understand diverse perspectives while upholding the principles of mercy and respect that lie at the heart of the Islamic faith.",
      "against": "Here is a potential concluding statement summarizing the key points made against the proposition that \"Islam permits homosexuality\":\n\nRespected members of this debate, throughout this discussion, I have presented clear and overwhelming evidence from the primary Islamic sources - the Quran and the Sunnah - as well as the scholarly consensus across generations, that Islam does not permit homosexual acts.  \n\nThe story of the people of Lut in the Quran, as interpreted by the overwhelming majority of exegetes, condemns the act of homosexuality itself as an immoral transgression against natural laws. Authentic hadiths from the Prophet Muhammad explicitly prohibit and denounce homosexual behavior in the strongest terms. \n\nClassical scholars like Ibn Kathir and Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani, as well as contemporary authorities like Al-Azhar University and major Islamic fiqh councils, have all affirmed that homosexuality is impermissible in Islam based on these clear scriptural injunctions.\n\nWhile I respect the call for compassion, human dignity, and different perspectives, Islamic teachings are based on divine revelation, not on contemporary social norms. Any interpretation permitting homosexuality would go against the explicit guidance provided by Allah and His Messenger Muhammad.\n\nTherefore, I firmly maintain that the proposition that \"Islam permits homosexuality\" cannot be accepted, as it contradicts the clear and overwhelming evidence from Islamic scriptural sources and the scholarly consensus throughout Islamic history.\n\nI urge all present to consider this evidence objectively and arrive at the conclusion that, while advocating for compassion towards all, we must uphold the teachings of Islam as per the guidance of the Quran and Sunnah. Thank you."
