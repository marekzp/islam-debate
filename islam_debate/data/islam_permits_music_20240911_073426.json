      "for": "Thank you for this opportunity to present my opening argument in favor of the proposition that Islam permits music.\n\nLadies and gentlemen, I stand before you today to argue that Islam, in its essence and in the practice of many Muslims throughout history and today, does indeed permit and even celebrate music as a form of artistic expression and spiritual elevation.\n\nFirstly, it's important to note that the Quran, the central religious text of Islam, does not explicitly prohibit music. In fact, the Quran mentions musical instruments in a positive light. For instance, in Surah Saba (34:10-11), it mentions that Prophet David was given a beautiful voice and that mountains and birds joined him in praise. This suggests an appreciation for melodious sounds and voices.\n\nSecondly, throughout Islamic history, music has played a significant role in various cultural and spiritual practices. The Sufi tradition, a mystical branch of Islam, has long used music and rhythmic movements as a means of achieving spiritual ecstasy and closeness to God. The famous 13th-century Persian poet and Sufi mystic, Rumi, often spoke of music as a path to the divine. He wrote, \"We have fallen into the place where everything is music\" (Coleman Barks, \"The Essential Rumi\").\n\nThirdly, many classical Islamic scholars have argued for the permissibility of music. For example, the renowned 11th-century scholar Imam al-Ghazali, in his work \"Ihya Ulum al-Din\" (Revival of Religious Sciences), devoted a section to the ethics of listening to music. He argued that music could be permissible and even beneficial when used for the right purposes and in the right context.\n\nFurthermore, the rich tradition of Islamic art music, such as the Maqam in the Arab world or the Dastgah in Iran, demonstrates that music has been an integral part of Islamic civilization for centuries. These traditions have been supported and patronized by Islamic rulers and institutions throughout history.\n\nLastly, it's worth noting that many contemporary Islamic scholars and institutions have issued fatwas (religious rulings) permitting music. For instance, Sheikh Yusuf al-Qaradawi, a prominent contemporary scholar, has stated that music is permissible as long as it doesn't contain inappropriate content or distract from religious duties.\n\nIn conclusion, while there have been and continue to be debates within Islamic scholarship about the permissibility of music, there is strong evidence from the Quran, Islamic history, scholarly opinions, and cultural practices to support the position that Islam does indeed permit music. Music, when used appropriately, can be a powerful tool for spiritual growth, cultural expression, and social cohesion within Islamic communities.\n\nThank you.\n\nCitations:\n\n1.

      "against": "Opening Argument:\n\nLadies and gentlemen, I stand before you today to argue against the proposition that Islam permits music. While this is a complex and nuanced issue within Islamic scholarship, there is substantial evidence from authoritative Islamic sources that suggests music is, at best, highly discouraged, and at worst, prohibited in Islam.\n\nFirstly, we must consider the Hadith, which are the recorded sayings and actions of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). There are several Hadith that explicitly warn against music and musical instruments. For instance, in Sahih al-Bukhari, one of the most respected collections of Hadith, it is narrated:\n\n\"From among my followers there will be some people who will consider illegal sexual intercourse, the wearing of silk, the drinking of alcoholic drinks and the use of musical instruments, as lawful.\" (Sahih al-Bukhari 5590)\n\nThis Hadith clearly groups musical instruments with other activities that are universally considered haram (forbidden) in Islam, suggesting that they too are prohibited.\n\nFurthermore, prominent Islamic scholars throughout history have interpreted Quranic verses and Hadith to prohibit or strongly discourage music. For example, Ibn al-Qayyim, a renowned 13th-century Islamic jurist, wrote in his book \"Ighathat al-Lahfan\":\n\n\"The Madhhab (position) of the four Imams is that all musical instruments are haram (forbidden).\" (Ibn al-Qayyim, Ighathat al-Lahfan)\n\nThis refers to the founders of the four major Sunni schools of Islamic jurisprudence, indicating a broad consensus among classical scholars on this issue.\n\nAdditionally, contemporary scholars such as Sheikh Abdul-Aziz ibn Baz, former Grand Mufti of Saudi Arabia, have issued fatwas (religious rulings) against music. In one such fatwa, he stated:\n\n\"It is well known that music, musical instruments and songs are haram (forbidden) according to the purified Shari'ah (Islamic law).\" (Fatwa no. 3818, Fatawa Ibn Baz)\n\nWhile it's important to acknowledge that there are differing opinions within Islamic scholarship, and some modern interpretations are more lenient, the weight of traditional evidence and scholarly opinion leans heavily towards the prohibition or strong discouragement of music in Islam.\n\nIn conclusion, based on Hadith, historical scholarly consensus, and contemporary religious rulings, there is a strong case to be made that Islam does not permit music, at least in its general form. This position is deeply rooted in Islamic tradition and jurisprudence, and cannot be easily dismissed."

      "for": "Rebuttal:\n\nThank you for presenting your arguments. While I respect the perspective you've shared, I believe there are several important counterpoints to consider that support the permissibility of music in Islam.\n\nFirstly, regarding the Hadith you cited from Sahih al-Bukhari, it's crucial to note that many scholars interpret this as a prophecy rather than a prohibition. The Hadith doesn't explicitly forbid music but rather predicts that some people will consider these things lawful. Moreover, the authenticity and interpretation of Hadiths related to music have been subjects of debate among Islamic scholars (Kristina Nelson, \"The Art of Reciting the Qur'an,\" 1985).\n\nSecondly, while you mention Ibn al-Qayyim's statement about the four Imams' position, it's important to note that this is a later interpretation and not necessarily reflective of the Imams' direct statements. In fact, there are reports that Imam Malik, one of the four Imams, permitted certain forms of music (Ibn Rushd, \"Bidayat al-Mujtahid\").\n\nFurthermore, the position of classical scholars is not as monolithic as suggested. For instance, Abu Hamid al-Ghazali, one of the most influential classical scholars, wrote extensively on the permissibility of music in certain contexts in his work \"Ihya Ulum al-Din\" (The Revival of the Religious Sciences).\n\nRegarding contemporary scholars, while Sheikh Abdul-Aziz ibn Baz's opinion is noted, it's important to recognize that there is a diversity of opinions among modern Islamic scholars. For instance, Sheikh Yusuf al-Qaradawi, a highly respected contemporary scholar, has stated:\n\n\"Music by itself is considered halal unless it is accompanied with something that is considered haram.\" (Al-Qaradawi, \"The Lawful and Prohibited in Islam\")\n\nMoreover, it's crucial to consider the historical and cultural context of Islamic civilization. The flourishing of musical traditions in various Islamic societies throughout history, from Andalusia to the Ottoman Empire, suggests a more nuanced approach to music than outright prohibition (Amnon Shiloah, \"Music in the World of Islam: A Socio-Cultural Study,\" 1995).\n\nLastly, we must consider the purpose and spirit of Islamic law. Islam encourages the pursuit of beauty and art as a means of spiritual elevation. The Quran itself states: \"Say, Who has forbidden the adornment of Allah which He has produced for His servants and the good [lawful] things of provision?\" (Quran 7:32). Many scholars interpret this as encompassing various forms of art, including music.\n\nIn conclusion, while acknowledging the diversity of opinions within Islamic scholarship, there is substantial evidence supporting the permissibility of music in Islam. This view is grounded in Quranic interpretation, historical practice, and the opinions of respected scholars both classical and contemporary.",
      "against": "Rebuttal:\n\nThank you for your thoughtful response. While I appreciate the points you've raised, I must respectfully disagree and maintain that the evidence against the permissibility of music in Islam is more compelling.\n\nFirstly, regarding the interpretation of the Hadith from Sahih al-Bukhari as a prophecy rather than a prohibition, it's important to note that many respected scholars have interpreted this Hadith as a clear indication of prohibition. For instance, Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani, in his authoritative commentary on Sahih al-Bukhari, \"Fath al-Bari,\" states:\n\n\"This Hadith indicates that these matters are prohibited, because the Prophet (peace be upon him) censured those who consider them lawful.\" (Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani, Fath al-Bari, 10/51)\n\nSecondly, while you mention that Ibn al-Qayyim's statement might not reflect the direct statements of the four Imams, it's crucial to note that numerous classical scholars have reported similar consensuses. For example, Ibn Rajab al-Hanbali stated:\n\n\"The four Imams and their followers are in agreement about the prohibition of listening to all musical instruments.\" (Ibn Rajab, Nuzhat al-Asma', p. 45)\n\nRegarding Al-Ghazali's position, while he did discuss music in \"Ihya Ulum al-Din,\" many scholars have pointed out that his views on this matter were not consistent with the majority opinion and have been critiqued by other prominent scholars (Ibn al-Qayyim, Ighathat al-Lahfan, 1/224-231).\n\nAs for Sheikh Yusuf al-Qaradawi's opinion, it's important to note that many contemporary scholars have criticized his views as being too lenient and not in line with traditional Islamic scholarship. Sheikh Salih al-Fawzan, for instance, has refuted al-Qaradawi's position on music (Al-Fawzan, Al-I'lam bi Naqd Kitab al-Halal wal-Haram fil-Islam).\n\nWhile you mention the historical presence of music in Islamic societies, it's crucial to differentiate between cultural practices and religious rulings. The presence of a practice does not necessarily indicate its permissibility in Islamic law. Many scholars argue that these musical traditions developed despite religious prohibitions, not because of religious approval (Muhammad Nasiruddin al-Albani, Tahrim Alat at-Tarab).\n\nLastly, regarding the Quranic verse you cited (7:32), classical exegetes have not typically interpreted this as encompassing music. For example, Ibn Kathir, in his renowned Tafsir, does not mention music in his explanation of this verse (Tafsir Ibn Kathir, 7:32).\n\nIn conclusion, while acknowledging the diversity of opinions, the weight of evidence from classical scholarship, Hadith interpretation, and the majority of contemporary scholars still leans heavily towards the prohibition or strong discouragement of music in Islam. This view is deeply rooted in Islamic jurisprudence and cannot be easily dismissed based on minority opinions or cultural practices."

      "for": "Concluding Statement:\n\nLadies and gentlemen, throughout this debate, we have explored the complex and nuanced topic of music's permissibility in Islam. After careful consideration of the evidence and arguments presented, I firmly maintain that Islam does indeed permit music, with certain conditions and contexts.\n\nLet me summarize the key points that support this position:\n\n1. Quranic Foundation: The Quran does not explicitly prohibit music. In fact, it mentions musical elements positively, such as David's beautiful voice joined by mountains and birds in praise.\n\n2. Historical Practice: Throughout Islamic history, music has played a significant role in cultural and spiritual practices. The rich traditions of Islamic art music and the use of music in Sufi practices demonstrate its integration into Islamic civilization.\n\n3. Scholarly Support: Respected scholars, both classical and contemporary, have argued for the permissibility of music. Imam al-Ghazali's writings on the ethics of listening to music and Sheikh Yusuf al-Qaradawi's modern fatwa permitting music with appropriate content showcase this scholarly support.\n\n4. Interpretation of Hadiths: While some Hadiths appear to discourage music, many scholars interpret these as contextual or predictive rather than universally prohibitive. The authenticity and interpretation of these Hadiths have been subjects of scholarly debate.\n\n5. Cultural Diversity: The flourishing of musical traditions across various Islamic societies throughout history suggests a more nuanced approach to music than outright prohibition.\n\n6. Spiritual and Artistic Value: Islam encourages the pursuit of beauty and art as means of spiritual elevation. Music, when used appropriately, can serve as a powerful tool for spiritual growth and cultural expression.\n\nWhile acknowledging the diversity of opinions within Islamic scholarship, the weight of evidence from the Quran, historical practice, scholarly opinions, and cultural traditions strongly supports the view that Islam permits music. This permissibility, of course, comes with the understanding that the content and context of the music should align with Islamic principles.\n\nIn conclusion, I argue that a balanced and contextual understanding of Islamic teachings reveals a space for music as a form of artistic expression, cultural heritage, and even spiritual practice within the bounds of Islamic ethics. Thank you.",
      "against": "Concluding Statement:\n\nLadies and gentlemen, throughout this debate, I have presented a robust case against the proposition that Islam permits music. Let me summarize the key points of my argument:\n\n1. Hadith Evidence: We have clear Hadith, such as the one from Sahih al-Bukhari, that group musical instruments with other prohibited activities. Respected scholars like Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani have interpreted these as prohibitions, not mere prophecies.\n\n2. Scholarly Consensus: There is a strong consensus among classical scholars, including the four major Sunni schools of jurisprudence, against the permissibility of music. This consensus, reported by scholars like Ibn al-Qayyim and Ibn Rajab al-Hanbali, carries significant weight in Islamic jurisprudence.\n\n3. Contemporary Scholarly Opinions: While acknowledging some dissenting voices, the majority of contemporary scholars, including prominent figures like Sheikh Abdul-Aziz ibn Baz and Sheikh Salih al-Fawzan, maintain the traditional stance against music.\n\n4. Interpretation of Quranic Verses: Classical exegetes have not interpreted verses such as Quran 7:32 as permitting music, contrary to some modern claims.\n\n5. Historical Context: While music has been present in Islamic societies, this does not equate to religious approval. Many scholars argue these practices developed despite religious prohibitions, not because of them.\n\nThroughout this debate, we've seen that while there are some differing opinions, the preponderance of evidence from authoritative Islamic sources - including Hadith, scholarly consensus, and contemporary rulings - supports the view that music is, at best, highly discouraged in Islam, and at worst, prohibited.\n\nIt's crucial to approach this topic with respect for the depth and complexity of Islamic jurisprudence. While cultural practices and minority opinions exist, they do not override the weight of traditional scholarship and majority rulings on this matter.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the evidence presented, I maintain that the proposition \"Islam permits music\" cannot be substantiated when examined against the bulk of Islamic legal tradition and scholarship. Thank you."
