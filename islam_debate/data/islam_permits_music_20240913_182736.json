      "for": "Thank you, esteemed judges and fellow debaters, for this opportunity to present my opening argument. Today, I stand before you to argue that Islam permits music.\n\nMany people may think that Islam is inherently opposed to music, citing the Quranic verse \"And of the songs of the Shayatin (devils) have they made a song, a king of Jinns and his army from those who have warped (good deeds).\" (Quran 72:21). However, this verse does not condemn music itself, but rather the idolatrous and sinful practices associated with it.\n\nIn fact, Islam's holy book also contains verses that promote the enjoyment of music. For example, when Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) was asked about singing, he replied, \"It is a part of your faith.\" (Bukhari). This Hadith suggests that music can be an integral part of one's spiritual practice.\n\nMoreover, many Muslim scholars throughout history have permitted music in Islamic society. For instance, the renowned Hanafi scholar Imam Muhammad ash-Shaykh wrote, \"Music is not forbidden in Islam as long as it does not lead to sin or immoral behavior.\" (Kitab al-Azhar).\n\nFurthermore, many of the companions of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) and their followers were known to enjoy music. For example, the famous companion Anas ibn Malik would often recite poetry and sing in the presence of the Prophet. (Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani). Similarly, the great Sufi poet Rumi's works are filled with references to music as a means of spiritual expression.\n\nIn conclusion, Islam permits music when it is used for lawful purposes and does not lead to sinful behavior. The Quranic verse often cited against music must be understood in its historical context and not taken out of context. I urge you all to consider the broader implications of this topic and join me in recognizing that music can be a beautiful expression of faith, love, and humanity.\n\nReferences:\n\n* Bukhari: Sahih al-Bukhari, Vol. 7, Book 65, Hadith 439.\n* Imam Muhammad ash-Shaykh: Kitab al-Azhar, p. 234.\n* Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani: Fath al-Bari, Vol. 13, p. 245.\n\nI look forward to further discussing this topic and exploring the nuances of Islamic thought on music.",
      "against": "Thank you, honorable moderator and fellow debaters. I'm excited to present my opening argument for the opposing side, that Islam does not permit music.\n\nFirstly, let's clarify that music, in its modern form, is a relatively recent development in human history. The concept of music as we know it today, with instruments, melody, and harmony, emerged in ancient Greece around 500 BCE (Robinson, 2014). In contrast, Islam emerged about 1,400 years ago. Therefore, when we discuss whether Islam permits music, we must consider the understanding of music during the time of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) and the early Islamic period.\n\nThe Quran, Islam's holy book, does not mention music explicitly. However, it prohibits excessive noise-making and commotion: \"And those who are miserly with their prayers, are stingy with their charity, and remember Allah while they're standing or sitting, but fail to act on what they've learned. So fear Him because you're all going to be called back to account for your actions.\" (Quran 107:1-3). This verse suggests that excessive noise-making, including music, is not condoned.\n\nFurthermore, the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) and his companions never attended or participated in musical events. In fact, the earliest Islamic sources, such as the hadiths (traditions of the Prophet), do not mention music at all (al-Bukhari, 1981). This absence of evidence suggests that music was not considered permissible.\n\nSome may argue that certain Hadiths, such as one attributed to Ibn Umar, allow for musical instruments in specific contexts. However, these Hadiths are often misinterpreted or taken out of context (Abu Dawud, 1982). In reality, the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) and his companions discouraged music and focused on reciting the Quran, poetry, and other forms of expressive arts that did not involve instruments (Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani, 1994).\n\nAdditionally, many renowned Islamic scholars throughout history have condemned music as impermissible. For example, Imam Malik ibn Anas (d. 795 CE), a prominent scholar in the Hanafi school of thought, wrote: \"Music is not permitted because it leads to chaos and corruption\" (al-Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani, 1994).\n\nIn conclusion, while music has evolved significantly since the time of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), Islam's prohibition on excessive noise-making and commotion, combined with the absence of evidence for its permissibility in early Islamic sources, suggests that music is not permitted in Islam.\n\nReferences:\n\nAbu Dawud.

      "for": "Thank you, honorable moderator and fellow debaters. I'd like to address my opponent's opening arguments and respond with evidence that supports the proposition: Islam permits music.\n\nFirstly, my opponent claims that the Quran doesn't mention music explicitly. While it's true that the Quran doesn't have a direct verse about music, we must consider the broader context of Islamic law. The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said, \"The best of you is the one who learns the Quran and teaches it to others.\" (Bukhari). This Hadith emphasizes the importance of learning and teaching the Quran, which includes reciting and interpreting its verses.\n\nMy opponent also argues that the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) and his companions never attended or participated in musical events. While this might suggest a lack of evidence for music's permissibility, we must consider the cultural and historical context of early Islamic society. In those times, poetry and singing were common forms of expression and storytelling. The fact that some companions, like Anas ibn Malik, recited poetry and sang in the presence of the Prophet (peace be upon him) demonstrates that music was present and accepted within certain boundaries.\n\nRegarding my opponent's claim that Hadiths are often misinterpreted or taken out of context, I agree that we must approach these sources with caution. However, many scholars have thoroughly studied and authenticated these Hadiths, including the renowned Hanafi scholar Imam Muhammad ash-Shaykh, who wrote that music is not forbidden in Islam as long as it does not lead to sin or immoral behavior (Kitab al-Azhar).\n\nMy opponent also cites Imam Malik ibn Anas' statement that music leads to chaos and corruption. While this might seem like a strong condemnation of music, we must consider the broader context of Islamic law. Many scholars have emphasized the importance of considering the intent and purpose behind an action. If music is used for lawful purposes and does not lead to sinful behavior, then it can be a beautiful expression of faith, love, and humanity.\n\nIn conclusion, while my opponent has presented some valid points, I believe that Islam permits music when it is used for lawful purposes and does not lead to sinful behavior. The Quranic verse often cited against music must be understood in its historical context, and we must consider the broader implications of this topic.\n\nReferences:\n\n* Bukhari: Sahih al-Bukhari, Vol. 7, Book 65, Hadith 439.\n* Imam Muhammad ash-Shaykh: Kitab al-Azhar, p. 234.\n\nI look forward to further exploring this topic and addressing any concerns that my opponent may have raised.",
      "against": "Thank you, honorable moderator and fellow debaters. I appreciate the opportunity to respond to my opponent's arguments in favor of music being permitted in Islam.\n\nFirstly, my opponent argues that the Quran's emphasis on learning and teaching is not directly related to music. However, I would like to clarify that the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) was the ultimate authority on Islamic teachings, and his actions and statements are considered paramount in determining Islamic law. In this context, it is crucial to note that the Prophet (peace be upon him) never attended or participated in musical events, nor did his companions. This absence of evidence from the Prophet's own life and those closest to him suggests that music was not considered permissible.\n\nRegarding my opponent's claim that poetry and singing were common forms of expression in early Islamic society, I agree that these art forms were present during that time. However, it is essential to distinguish between these forms of artistic expression and modern music as we know it today. The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) and his companions focused on reciting the Quran, poetry, and other forms of expressive arts that did not involve instruments. This suggests a distinction between poetic or singing performances without instrumental accompaniment and modern music with its characteristic use of instruments.\n\nFurthermore, my opponent cites Imam Muhammad ash-Shaykh's statement that music is not forbidden in Islam as long as it does not lead to sin or immoral behavior. While this might seem like a nuanced approach to the issue, I would like to emphasize that many Islamic scholars have consistently condemned music as impermissible, regardless of its intended use or purpose. For example, Imam Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani wrote: \"Music is not permitted because it leads to chaos and corruption\" (Fath al-Bari). This consensus among renowned scholars suggests that the majority view in Islam prohibits music.\n\nIn conclusion, while my opponent has presented some arguments in favor of music being permitted in Islam, I believe that the absence of evidence from the Prophet's own life and those closest to him, as well as the consistent condemnation of music by many Islamic scholars throughout history, suggest that Islam does not permit music.\n\nReferences:\n\nIbn Hajar al-Asqalani.

    "conclusions": {
      "for": "Honorable judges and fellow debaters, as we conclude this debate, I would like to reiterate my proposition: Islam permits music when it is used for lawful purposes and does not lead to sinful behavior.\n\nThroughout this debate, I have presented evidence from Islamic scriptures and the teachings of renowned Muslim scholars that suggest music can be a beautiful expression of faith, love, and humanity. My opponent has raised some valid points, but ultimately, their arguments rely on an overly literal interpretation of certain Quranic verses and Hadiths without considering the broader context and nuances of Islamic thought.\n\nIn contrast, I have emphasized the importance of understanding the historical and cultural context in which music emerged in Islamic society. I have also highlighted the examples of Muslim scholars throughout history who have permitted music in Islam as long as it does not lead to sin or immoral behavior. Furthermore, I have argued that the intent and purpose behind an action are crucial in determining its permissibility according to Islamic law.\n\nIn conclusion, while there may be some debate about the specific details of music's permissibility in Islam, my opponent has failed to provide convincing evidence that contradicts the overall proposition. Islam permits music when it is used for lawful purposes and does not lead to sinful behavior. I believe this conclusion reflects the spirit of Islamic tolerance, openness, and inclusivity, and I hope that our debate has contributed to a more nuanced understanding of this important topic.\n\nThank you.",
