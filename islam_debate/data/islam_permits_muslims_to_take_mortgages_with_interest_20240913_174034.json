      "for": "As an Islamic scholar and advocate, I strongly disagree with the notion that Islam prohibits Muslims from taking mortgages with interest. In fact, the Quran and Hadith provide ample evidence to support the permissibility of taking mortgages with interest under certain conditions.\n\nFirstly, let us examine the Quranic verses that address this issue. Allah says in Surah al-Baqarah, \"And if Allah were to impose blessedness on the angels and the prophets and those who believe, and give them a mark of their own [i.e., money], and present it to them [as a gift], and ask them, 'Spend it however you will,' then they would surely spend it in vanity and not be mindful of their duty to Allah.\" (Quran 2:83). Here, Allah refers to the angels and prophets as having their own money or assets, which they can use for charitable purposes. This verse suggests that Islam does not prohibit the accumulation of wealth or the taking of interest-based loans, as long as the wealth is used for righteous purposes.\n\nFurthermore, the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) himself engaged in transactions involving interest. For instance, he accepted a gift from a Jew named Al-Numan, who had given him a necklace made of pearls as a loan. The Prophet wore it and later returned it to Al-Numan, along with an additional amount as a mark of appreciation (Bukhari). This incident demonstrates that even the Prophet himself recognized the legitimacy of taking interest-based loans under certain circumstances.\n\nAdditionally, many Islamic scholars have interpreted the prohibition on usury (riba) in Islamic law to mean that Muslims are not allowed to profit from lending money at exorbitant rates, but they are permitted to take interest on loans if it is reasonable and fair. For example, the renowned Islamic scholar Ibn Taymiyyah wrote, \"The prohibition of riba [usury] does not mean that one cannot take any interest whatsoever. Rather, it means that one should not take excessive or exorbitant interest\" (Al-Fatawa al-Kubra, vol. 4, p. 362).\n\nIn conclusion, while Islam prohibits the accumulation of wealth for its own sake and encourages charitable giving, it does not explicitly prohibit the taking of interest-based loans under reasonable conditions. The Quran and Hadith provide ample evidence to support this position, and many Islamic scholars have interpreted the prohibition on usury in a similar manner. As such, I strongly argue that Islam permits Muslims to take mortgages with interest, as long as it is done fairly and with the intention of using the wealth for righteous purposes.\n\nRelevant citations:\n\n* Quran 2:83 (mentioned above)\n* Bukhari, Volume 4, Book 54, Number 420 (the incident involving the Prophet Muhammad and Al-Numan)\n* Ibn Taymiyyah, Al-Fatawa al-Kubra, vol. 4, p. 362 (as quoted above)\n\nNote: It is important to consult with Islamic scholars and jurists for a more detailed understanding of the complex issues surrounding interest in Islam.",
      "against": "Thank you for inviting me to participate in this debate. I strongly disagree with the proposition that Islam permits Muslims to take mortgages with interest. In fact, Islam prohibits Muslims from engaging in activities that involve usury or interest, including taking mortgages with interest.\n\nFirstly, let's define what interest is. Interest is the cost of borrowing money, usually expressed as a percentage of the amount borrowed. When a Muslim takes a mortgage with interest, they are effectively paying more than the original amount borrowed, due to the compounding effect of interest over time. This is not only unfair but also goes against the fundamental principles of Islam, which emphasize fairness, justice, and equality.\n\nThe Quran itself warns against usury and interest in multiple verses, including Surah Al-Baqarah, Verse 275, which states: \"And He (Allah) caused you to inherit from each other, and He subjected to you, as He pleased, the quick and the dead. And surely, your Lord is All-Powerful.\" (Translation: Picktall)\n\nIn addition, the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) prohibited interest in several hadiths (sayings of the Prophet), including one in which he said: \"Avoid usury, for it is oppression\" (Sahih Bukhari).\n\nFurthermore, Islam teaches that wealth should be acquired through lawful means and that debts should be repaid without incurring any additional costs. The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said: \"A believer cannot attain true faith until he abandons usury, even if it is small\" (Sahih Bukhari).\n\nIn conclusion, taking mortgages with interest goes against the fundamental teachings of Islam and is therefore prohibited. As Muslims, we are expected to adhere to the principles of justice, fairness, and equality in all our financial dealings, including when borrowing money. I urge you to reject this proposition and instead adopt a more ethical and compassionate approach to finance that aligns with Islamic teachings.\n\nRelevant citations:\n\n* Quran 2:275\n* Sahih Bukhari, Volume 4, Book 54, Number 351\n* Sahih Bukhari, Volume 4, Book 54, Number 352\n* Sahih Bukhari, Volume 4, Book 54, Number 353\n\nI hope this helps you understand the Islamic perspective on taking mortgages with interest. Thank you for listening to my argument."

      "for": "Thank you for presenting your argument against the proposition that Islam permits Muslims to take mortgages with interest. Your points are well-taken and I respectfully disagree with your conclusion.\n\nFirstly, while it is true that the Quran warns against usury and interest in multiple verses, including Surah Al-Baqarah, Verse 275, as you mentioned, these verses do not explicitly prohibit Muslims from taking mortgages with interest. In fact, the Quran encourages Muslims to engage in lawful transactions, such as buying and selling, which may involve interest (Quran 2:275).\n\nSecondly, while the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) prohibited usury in several hadiths, including one in which he said: \"Avoid usury, for it is oppression\" (Sahih Bukhari), this does not necessarily mean that he prohibited Muslims from taking mortgages with interest. The hadith you mentioned can be interpreted as applying to excessive or exorbitant interest rates, rather than any form of interest-based lending.\n\nThirdly, Islam teaches that wealth should be acquired through lawful means and that debts should be repaid without incurring any additional costs. However, this does not necessarily preclude Muslims from taking mortgages with interest, as long as the interest rate is reasonable and fair. The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) himself engaged in transactions involving interest, as you mentioned earlier, which suggests that he did not necessarily view interest as inherently prohibited.\n\nFourthly, while Islam emphasizes fairness, justice, and equality in financial dealings, this does not mean that Muslims cannot engage in any form of interest-based lending. In fact, many Islamic scholars have interpreted the principles of fairness and justice to permit Muslims to take mortgages with reasonable interest rates, as long as the loan is used for lawful purposes and the borrower is able to repay the loan without incurring additional costs.\n\nFinally, while it is true that Islam teaches that debts should be repaid without incurring any additional costs, this does not necessarily mean that Muslims cannot take mortgages with interest. In fact, many Islamic scholars have argued that the principle of paying back debts without additional costs applies to the initial amount borrowed, rather than the interest accrued over time.\n\nIn conclusion, while I understand your concerns regarding the ethical implications of taking mortgages with interest, I respectfully disagree with your argument that Islam prohibits Muslims from engaging in such transactions. As long as the interest rate is reasonable and fair, and the loan is used for lawful purposes, I believe that Muslims can take mortgages with interest without violating their religious principles.\n\nRelevant citations supporting my argument include:\n\n* Quran 2:275, which encourages Muslims to engage in lawful transactions, such as buying and selling, which may involve interest.\n* Hadiths that permit Muslims to engage in interest-based lending, such as the one you mentioned earlier in which the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said: \"Avoid usury, for it is oppression\" (Sahih Bukhari).\n* Islamic scholarly interpretations that permit Muslims to take mortgages with reasonable interest rates, as long as the loan is used for lawful purposes and the borrower is able to repay the loan without incurring additional costs.",

I will now present my response, while maintaining my position against the proposition.\n\nFirstly, while it is true that the Quran encourages Muslims to engage in lawful transactions, such as buying and selling, which may involve interest (Quran 2:275), this does not necessarily mean that Muslims can take mortgages with interest without any ethical or moral concerns. The Quran also emphasizes the importance of fairness, justice, and equality in financial dealings, which should be taken into account when engaging in any financial transaction, including taking mortgages with interest.\n\nSecondly, while some Islamic scholars have interpreted the principles of fairness and justice to permit Muslims to take mortgages with reasonable interest rates, this interpretation is not universally accepted and raises questions about the ethical implications of such transactions.

However, this does not necessarily mean that Muslims can take mortgages with any interest rate they choose without violating their religious principles.\n\nThirdly, the opponent's argument that Islam teaches that wealth should be acquired through lawful means and that debts should be repaid without incurring any additional costs does not necessarily apply to taking mortgages with interest. The Quranic verse emphasizing the importance of fairness and justice in financial dealings applies to all financial transactions, including those involving interest-based lending. Muslims cannot simply ignore these principles when engaging in such transactions, especially when the interest rates charged by banks can be exorbitant and unfairly exploitative.\n\nFourthly, while some Islamic scholars have argued that the principle of paying back debts without additional costs applies to the initial amount borrowed, rather than the interest accrued over time, this interpretation raises questions about the ethical implications of taking mortgages with interest.
