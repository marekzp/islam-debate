      "for": "Ladies and Gentlemen,\n\nThank you for allowing me the opportunity to speak today. The assertion I wish to affirm is that \u2018Islam permits Muslims to take mortgages with interest.\u2019\n\nIn grounding my argument first and foremost, it is absolutely undeniable that a core principle within Islam, emanating from the Quran, is the prohibition of Riba, often translated as usury or interest. This is clearly explicated within Quran 2:275-280 and surrounding surahs. That being said, the question here is not about the general prohibition of interest, but about whether taking a mortgage with interest on it is permitted within Islamic law given certain circumstances.\n\nIt is here that I\u2019d like to introduce the principle of 'darura', or necessity, as recognized by Islamic jurisprudence. The principle of darura accepts that in cases of extreme necessity or hardship, prohibitions may be relaxed. This principle has been recorded within Islamic law as referenced by Ibn Qudama in Al-Mughni, with regards to the consumption of prohibited food and drink when starvation threatens life (Al-Mughni, Ibn Qudama, 6/423).\n\nThus, by virtue of darura, if a Muslim is living in a non-Muslim country where it is incredibly difficult or nearly impossible to find a house without a mortgage involving interest, the prohibition on Riba can be suspended because of necessity. \n\nThe European Council for Fatwa and Research (ECFR) has echoed this sentiment, citing that the permission to purchase homes under the conventional mortgage system in non-Muslim countries, taking into account both the difficulty for Muslims to find accommodations and the imbalance in the price of land and property in these countries compared to the Muslims\u2019 material capabilities. The ECFR notes that this permission is a type of necessity, and thus not a general permission (Resolution No.6 (7/1), 12th Ordinary Session in 2004).\n\nFurthermore, Sheikh Yusuf al-Qaradawi, a globally renowned Islamic scholar, has agreed that there are conditions under which a mortgage-based purchase of a house can be allowed. He stated, \u201c...if a Muslim is forced to take out a Riba-based loan, his sin will be lighter because he is coerced\u201d (Fataawa Mu'aasirah, 3/287).\n\nHence, my dear audience, while we fully acknowledge the strict prohibition of interest or Riba in Islam, we must also appreciate the flexibility that Islam provides within the scope of necessity, paving the way for the interpretation that Islam permits Muslims to take mortgages with interest, given specific circumstances and conditions. \n\nThank you.",
      "against": "Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed panelists, and revered attendees, \n\nToday, I have the unique opportunity to argue against a commonly held misconception: the belief that Islam permits Muslims to take mortgages with interest. A careful examination of Islamic law and theology reveals that the issue is not as straightforward as some might suggest. On the contrary, Islam, as dictated by the Holy Quran, clearly prohibits any interest-based financial transactions, including conventional mortgages. This prohibition is based on the principle of \u2018Riba\u2019, typically translated as \u2018Interest\u2019 or 'Usury', which is explicitly deemed forbidden within the religious text. \n\nThe Holy Quran states in Al-Baqarah [2:275]: \"Those who consume interest cannot stand [on the Day of Resurrection] except as one stands who is being beaten by Satan into insanity. That is because they say, 'Trade is [just] like interest.' But Allah has permitted trade and has forbidden interest.\" The implications of this verse are clear and backed by various scholars and Islamic seminaries across the globe. \n\nFurthermore, the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, also strongly condemned any transactions that involve Riba. In a Hadith reported by Jabir, mentioned in Sahih Muslim 1598, it is said: \"The Messenger of Allah cursed the accepter of interest and its payer, and one who records it, and the two witnesses, and he said: They are all equal.\" This further solidifies the religious position against interest-based transactions.\n\nFrom these primary sources, it becomes evident that, contrary to the proposition on offer, Islam does not permit Muslims to take mortgages with interest. Indeed, the underpinning economic principle within Islam is the sharing of profit and loss, encouraging risk participation rather than profiting from financial transactions such as conventional mortgages which are based on interest accrual. This system encourages social justice and equality, where the money lender and the borrower mutually share the risk and the return. As such, the religion promotes alternative financing methods such as Musharakah (partnership) and Murabaha (cost plus financing) to promote a more ethical and fair economy. \n\nIn conclusion, considering both the theological texts and the economic philosophies inherent within the religion, it is evident that Islam prohibits the participation of Muslims in interest-based transactions and conventional mortgage services. It is, therefore, crucial for Muslims to make efforts to find suitable alternatives in line with their faith and Islamic law, rather than attempting to reconcile the irreconcilable."

      "for": "Esteemed opponents, ladies and gentlemen,\n\nThank you for your careful insights. I acknowledge your excellent exposition upon the principle of Riba and its overarching prohibition within Islam. However, I must emphasize that the issue at hand concerns whether or not there exist situations where the taking of mortgages with interest might be permissible within Islamic law - not whether interest or Riba as a whole is forbidden.\n\nIndeed, we don't contest the general prohibition of Riba in Islamic law. However, as I have already conveyed in myopening argument, Islamic jurists have highlighted cases where exceptions are made based on the concept of 'darura' or necessity. This principle is widely recognized throughout the Islamic legal tradition, as represented in the works of traditional scholars and contemporary bodies such as the European Council for Fatwa and Research, evidencing the contemporary complexities of housing issues in non-Muslim countries. \n\nRegarding your point on promoting alternative financial systems such as Musharakah and Murabaha, these methods, while ideal, are not easily accessible or practical in many non-Muslim countries. The reality of the situation for many Muslims living in non-Muslim countries shuttles them towards the necessitated permission to obtain a conventional mortgage, so as not to endure hardship or homelessness. Islamic scholar Sheikh Wahba al-Zuhayli clarifies this in his \u201cFinancial Transactions in Islamic Jurisprudence\u201d (vol. 2, pp.281-282) stating that if Muslims in these countries cannot find a way to purchase homes without going into debt via a Riba-entailing loan, \u201cit is hoped that he will be forgiven for this necessity.\u201d\n\nContrary to the theoretical proposition that Muslims should seek alternatives, the practical realities often necessitate exactly the opposite. The procuring of a conventional mortgage is widely accepted as such a course of action by Islamic bodies such as the European Council for Fatwa and Research under the concept of 'darura'. \n\nIn response to your claim of reconciling the irreconcilable, it is fundamental to remember that Islamic law is not a monolith but dynamic, obligated to deal with the complexities of practical situations as they arise. As the Holy Quran affirms in Al-Baqarah [2:185]: \"Allah intends for you ease and does not intend for you hardship.\"\n\nTherefore, while completely recognizing the strong prohibition of interest in Islam, there is still room for interpretation and flexibility under specific circumstances surrounding necessity, housing crises, and the absence of practical alternatives, leading us back to the understanding that Islam could permit Muslims to take mortgages with interest, given certain conditions.\n\nThank you.",
      "against": "Esteemed panelists, respected attendees,\n\nI appreciate my opponent's points and the acknowledgment of our shared understanding of the prohibition of Riba in Islam. I understand the arguments put forward surrounding the concept of 'darura' or necessity, and the practical difficulties faced by many in obtaining ethical Islamic financing.\n\nHowever, I feel it is important to point out that our interpretation of 'darura' seems to diverge. While 'darura' does permit certain prohibitions under dire circumstances, it is crucial to differentiate between survival and comfort. Does not being able to secure a mortgage equate to a situation of impending doom or hardship that threatens survival, thus warranting the use of 'darura'? This is debatable and the scale of necessity must be weighed carefully.\n\nTo elaborate, Sheikh Salman al-Oadah, a prominent Saudi Islamic scholar, iterated that 'darura' or necessity, that would make Riba permissible must be of a lifesaving nature. Unable to secure a home is a considerable life difficulties issue, but it does not threaten a person's life, especially in societies with welfare systems and public housing schemes. Hence, there is a difference between a situation that constitutes a hardship and that which led to actual harm or the risk of harm (Sheikh Salman al-Oadah, \u201cWhen is Necessity Considered Necessity?\u201d IslamToday).\n\nFurthermore, it is also essential to consider the potential long-term implications and societal effects of this exception. If we start to treat 'darura' as a blanket justification for any difficult circumstance, it risks diminishing the firm standing of the prohibition of Riba, leading potentially to a slippery slope. \n\nImportantly, applying the 'darura' principle should not prevent Muslims from seeking to establish and advocate for Sharia-compliant financial systems. The practical difficulties faced by Muslims should motivate and drive the establishment of more available, practical, and widespread Islamic financing.\n\nPertaining to Sheikh al-Zuhayli's statement, I would argue it serves as a reassurance for those facing extreme hardship, not a widely applicable justification for Muslims to participate in Riba-based transactions. Rather, we should aim to promote Musharakah, Murabaha, and other forms of permissible banking to help Muslims adhere to their faith and ethical principles amidst the challenges.\n\nIn conclusion, while acknowledging the practical hardships many Muslims face, I still maintain that based on Islamic theology and principles of necessity, Islam does not permit Muslims to take conventional mortgages with interest. As Muslims, we must strive to resist the tide, persist in our advocacy, and continue our fight for fair economic systems that align with our faith.\n\nThank you."

    "conclusions": {
      "for": "Ladies and gentlemen,\n\nIn conclusion, our debate today has not been on the prohibition of Riba or interest under general circumstances in Islam - a principle we all agree upon. Instead, we have been discussing whether there are specific conditions wherein this prohibition might be relaxed within Islamic law, in this case, enabling a Muslim to procure a mortgage with interest.\n\nWe've delved into the concept of 'darura' or necessity, an established principle in Islamic jurisprudence that recognizes relaxation of certain prohibitions based on hardship or essential need. This principle, grounded in Islamic scholarly tradition, has been supported by contemporary bodies such as the European Council for Fatwa and Research in the context of housing crises in non-Muslim countries. They argue for the permissibility of mortgage under conventional systems as a form of necessity. This argument is further supported theoretically by Islamic scholars, such as Sheikh Wahba al-Zuhayli.\n\nWhile we acknowledge the Islamic call for alternatives to interest-based economic systems, we also realize the complexities of practical implementation in many parts of the world. Therefore, while the ideal is to avoid interest-based transactions altogether, practical circumstances and their specificities often demand a flexible approach, copyrighting the need to potentially seek a conventional mortgage in the absence of a viable alternative.\n\nHence, acknowledging these nuances and complexities, it remains our assertion that, under certain circumstances, Islam permits Muslims to take mortgages with interest. This interpretation is not a radical departure from Islam's foundational teachings but rather an embrace of its inherent adaptability to human hardship and practical realities.\n\nI thank you all for this rigorous and insightful exchange of perspectives.",
      "against": "Ladies and gentlemen, respected opponents,\n\nThroughout this discussion, we have navigated through the complexity and nuances of a critical economic-ethical matter within the Islamic community: the permissibility of conventional interest-bearing mortgages. The preponderance of evidence from our revered religious texts, the Holy Quran and Hadith, incontrovertibly espouses a strong prohibition on 'Riba' or interest, which indeed applies to conventional mortgages.\n\nHowever, recognizing the challenging realities of securing housing, especially for those residing in non-Muslim societies, I am aware that some exceptions, grounded on the concept of 'darura' or necessity, have been suggested by some scholars and authorities. Nonetheless, I firmly believe that 'darura' must be defined with care, circumspection, and respect for the sanctity of the prohibitions established by our faith. It is not intended as a broad justification for flouting fundamental Islamic laws, but rather as an exception for dire, life-threatening circumstances.\n\nEmphasizing this, I hold that the principle of 'darura' should not deter us from striving, persisting, and advocating for the expansion and accessibility of ethical, Sharia-compliant modes of financing, such as Musharakah and Murabaha. The challenges faced should drive us towards creating a just, equitable economic framework in line with our beliefs, not towards finding loopholes within our religion's strictures.\n\nIn conclusion, while I stand firm against the proposition that Islam permits Muslims to enter into interest-based mortgage agreements, I simultaneously urge the Muslim community worldwide to continue their efforts in fostering and establishing viable alternatives for interest-free financing. We must remember that the road to a just and equitable society might be long and arduous, but it is, undoubtedly, a path worth treading for the sake of adhering to our faith and principles. \n\nThank you."
