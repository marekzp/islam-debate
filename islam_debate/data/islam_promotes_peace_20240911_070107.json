      "for": "Ladies and Gentlemen, \n\nToday, I stand before you representing the affirmative side of the argument, asserting and endorsing the position that Islam indeed promotes peace. This claim is by no means a deceptive rosy portrayal of the reality but is embedded in the very root of this religion, its holy scriptures, teachings, and the life of its prophet, Muhammad (peace be upon him).\n\nFirst and foremost, let's start from the etymological standpoint. The word \u2018Islam\u2019 itself, derived from the Arabic root word \u2018Salam\u2019 signifies peace, safety, and submission, underscoring a harmonious avoidance of conflict or violence (Etymonline, 2020). The name of the religion itself is a testament to its objective of fostering a peaceful world.\n\nMoving to the teachings of Islam, we anchor our argument in the fundamental texts of Islam - The Quran and Hadith. The Quran repeatedly emphasizes the virtue of peace, teaching Muslims that peace is the rule and warfare is an exception, allowed only under certain specific conditions (Quran, 2:190, 5:32). Moreover, the Prophet Muhammad, symbolizes a living embodiment of these teachings. For instance, his peace treaty called the Treaty of Hudaybiyyah is widely recognized as a manifest demonstration of his preference for peace over violence (Sunan Abi Dawud, 13:76). \n\nHowever, it is essential to distinguish between the teachings of a faith and the actions taken by some of its followers, who might misinterpret or misuse these teachings. Any act that promotes violence or harm cannot be attributed to Islam but should be seen as the act of individuals, whose interpretation of religion might be skewed or personal.\n\nLastly, we should not ignore the role of Muslims on the global stage in peace-building and conflict resolution initiatives, organizations such as Islamic Relief Worldwide, and prominent Muslim figures who won the Nobel Peace prize like Muhammad Yunus, Malala Yousafzai, or the late Anwar Sadat.\n\nIn conclusion, Islam is an advocate of peace, and it encourages its followers to be harmonious, respectable, tolerant, and avoid unnecessary conflicts whenever possible. It encourages its believers to cohabit peacefully within the society, treating non-Muslims with kindness and respect. Any deviation from this path does not represent Islam but represents individual actions driven by personal interest and motives. Therefore, understanding Islam's central teachings is pivotal before making any assumptions about its stand on peace.\n\nReferences:\n\n- Online Etymology Dictionary. (2020).

      "against": "Ladies and Gentlemen, whilst I deeply respect all individual beliefs and the right to freely practice one's religion, today I am here to propose that the idea that \"Islam Promotes Peace\" is not universally valid. Not that Islam, in essence, encourages violence by any means, but that its interpretation has been historically and continues to be, subject to manipulation perpetuating conflict and violence.\n\nPrimarily, it is essential to understand that Islam is not a monolithic religion. There are many interpretations, some of which have been invoked in support of armed conflict. It is indeed inescapable to notice that a number of terrorist groups such as Al-Qaeda, ISIS, Al-Shabaab or Boko Haram claim to be driven by the religious doctrine of Islam (Byman, 2015).\n\nThe reasons for such associations can be traced back to the scriptures themselves. For instance, within Islamic texts, there are passages such as Surah Al-Baqarah (2:191), which has been used to justify violence: \"And kill them wherever you find them, and turn them out from where they have turned you out...\" amongst many other contentious interpretations. As noted by Holbrook (2014), the Quran\u2019s \u2018verses of the sword\u2019 eclipse its prior teachings of tolerance and restraint.\n\nMoreover, the Pew Research Center conducted a survey that revealed massive support for Sharia law in numerous Muslim-majority countries. Under this law, punishments such as amputations for theft and stoning for adultery apply, which do not align with notions of peace (Pew Research Center, 2013).\n\nIt is crucial to reiterate that many of these contentious interpretations are made by a fraction of the Muslim population. However, the use of Islam's name for promoting violence cannot be overlooked. Thus, the proposition that 'Islam promotes peace' is a debatable one.\n\nReferences:\n1. Byman, D. (2015).

      "for": "Respected Ladies and Gentlemen,\n\nI acknowledge the arguments raised by my counterpart, regarding the issues of interpretation and perceived violence associated with the religion of Islam. However, I maintain my position that Islam, as a religion and spiritual guide, indeed promotes peace. It is the misinterpretation and manipulation of its teachings and words, I would argue, that lead to unfortunate misconceptions and misuse.\n\nFirstly, it\u2019s important to realize that no religion in its essence promotes harm or violence. Problems arise when religious texts are interpreted out of context. The verse from Surah Al-Baqarah (2:191) cited by my opponent is indeed present in the Quran, yet its context, which is often omitted, provides a different insight. As Muslim scholars like Sheikh Ahmad Kutty indicate, this verse was revealed during wartime, instructing the Muslims on what to do when they are attacked. It is pivotal to consider it in conjunction with the next verse (Quran, 2:192), which states: \"But if they cease, then Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.\" (Kutty, 2015). This urges peace and restraint as soon as the enemy stops attacking, indicating the defensive nature of this instruction.\n\nFurthermore, the implementation of Sharia laws, as mentioned, is a contentious topic, and should not be viewed as an accurate portrayal of Islam but rather as varying cultural practices and legal jurisprudence in different societies (Dupret, Berger & Al-Zwaini, 1999). Moreover, the majority of these laws attribute to the deterrent effect with capital punishments for the gravest crimes, not intending to execute but dissuade perpetrators from causing harm (Ali, 1999).\n\nComing back to the mention of certain extremist groups who use Islam as their banner, I'd like to agree upon the fact that these groups do not represent or reflect the teachings of Islam. Instead, they are a testament to the misuse of any ideology or religion to fulfil their personal, political or territorial ambitions (Abou El Fadl, 2014). Violence cannot be ascribed to a religion merely because some individuals or groups claim to act in its name and distort its teachings for their ends.\n\nIn conclusion, while misinterpretations and misrepresentations occur, they do not detract from the fact that at its core, Islam fundamentally promotes peace and advocates for justice, equality, and respect for all.\n\nReferences:\n- Kutty, A.

      "against": "Respected peers,\n\nI appreciate my opponent's effort to highlight the peaceful aspects of Islam. It is indeed essential to remember that any discussion concerning the interpretation of Islam should not generalise about its followers; cultural, political, and socio-economic factors undeniably contribute to diverse behaviours. However, looking solely at the peaceful aspect of Islam and ignoring its other uses and interpretations does not provide a complete picture. This discourse isn\u2019t a criticism of the faith or its followers but rather focusing on the question, \u201cDoes Islam promote peace?\u201d.\n\nIt is important to highlight that though the verses from Surah Al-Baqarah provided a context of wartime, they are open-ended, making them susceptible to misinterpretation. Whilst scholars like Sheikh Ahmad Kutty emphasize the defensive nature of these verses, their flexible interpretation has been used as a call to arms by various non-state actors (Bergen, 2018).\n\nRegarding Sharia law, it is indeed culturally and locally interpreted; however, it is nevertheless rooted in Islamic texts and traditions (Hashmi, 2012). To minimise its relevance makes us overlook the fact that harsh procedures are often followed in its application, like the death penalty for apostasy or homosexuality, which is far from peaceful. It disregards the lack of personal freedom, including the religious freedom endorsed by numerous international human rights treaties and agreements.\n\nAs for violent organizations claiming to act under the name of Islam, they cannot be simply dismissed as outliers. Their narratives are based on their extreme interpretations of Islamic texts, and they draw upon Islamic symbolism, rhetoric, history, motivation, and justification (George Washington University, 2017). Acknowledging this reality does not equate to judging all of Islam or its followers but rather an understanding that their ideological roots are intertwined with the religion.\n\nIf we are to state that 'Islam promotes peace', we must also acknowledge those interpretations that contradict the notion. Ignoring them does not make them vanish. Allowing this discussion can contribute to the contestation of extremist narratives, and a more significant effort towards peace.\n\nReferences:\n\n1.

    "conclusions": {
      "for": "Ladies and Gentlemen,\n\nIn concluding this debate, I must reiterate that Islam, fundamentally and at its core, promotes peace, compassion, equality and respect for all. Embedded in its very name and teachings, this religion urges its believers to avoid conflict, respect life, and advocate for justice. It is not to be overlooked that the Prophet Muhammad himself demonstrated these values through his life experiences and propounded peace, even amidst conflict. \n\nThe issues raised by my opponent brought up important discussions around interpretations and perceived violence linked with Islam, but I urge us all to remember that these instances of misappropriation do not negate the central peace-centric teachings of Islam. Misinterpretations and misappropriations of religious texts, like Surah Al-Baqarah (2:191), when taken out of context, breed misconceptions and misuse. Similarly, the implementation of Sharia laws varies across different societies and cultures and should not be seen as a monolithic representation of Islam.\n\nFurthermore, it is crucial to distinguish that violent acts committed by a fraction of individuals or groups, under the banner of Islam, actually misrepresent Islamic teachings. It would be incorrect and untruthful to ascribe these misguided actions to the religion in entirety. Instead, one must understand that these actions often stem from their personal goals, ambitions, or political motives. \n\nTo truly understand the peaceful essence of Islam, one must study it beyond the stereotypes, misconceptions and misuses. Understanding the root of Islam and its teachings form the foundational step to acknowledge that Islam, indeed, promotes peace. \n\nIn conclusion, Islam, as a religion and spiritual guide, despite instances of misinterpretation and misuse, consistently promotes peace and harmony, advocating a peaceful coexistence amongst all beings. Thank you.",
      "against": "Ladies and Gentlemen,\n\nIn conclusion, the contention has never been to demonize Islam or its followers, but rather to explore, in an academic manner, its interpretations by individuals and groups that result in violence and conflict. We examined several instances where sections of the religious text have been used to justify violence. We pointed out the varied interpretations of verses such as the one from Surah Al-Baqarah, which have been used both defensively and provocatively, underscoring subjective interpretation.\n\nThe enforcement of Sharia laws was another dimension explored to highlight how legal codes supposedly based on Islam have often been implemented in ways in direct contradiction to principles of peace and compassion. We acknowledged that certain interpretations of Sharia are culturally influenced yet rooted in Islamic traditions.\n\nLastly, we delved into the existence of extremist groups adopting the banner of Islam and took cautious steps not to lump them with the broader global Muslim community, whilst highlighting that their radical interpretation and misuse of Islamic teachings should not be entirely dismissed.\n\nTo reiterate, our objective in this discourse was never to label Islam as innately violent but to emphasize the room for interpretation within the religious texts that have at times been exploited to incite and justify violence. Thus, the assertion that 'Islam promotes peace' cannot be universally validated without acknowledging the fact that there are interpretations of it that, unfortunately, promote the contrary. \n\nThis discussion, in no way, disrespects Islam, but only attempts to critically analyze aspects of its interpretation and representation relevant to our debate today. We believe that such high-spirited dialogues can lead to increased understanding and disarming of extremist narratives."
