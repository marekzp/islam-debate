      "for": "Thank you, esteemed opponents and honorable judges. I'm delighted to present my opening argument in support of the proposition that \"Islam promotes peace.\"\n\nAt its core, Islam is a religion that emphasizes compassion, mercy, and justice. The Quran, the holy book of Islam, repeatedly stresses the importance of maintaining peaceful relationships with others. In fact, the word \"salaam\" (peace) appears over 1,400 times in the Quran.\n\nOne of the most profound verses on this topic is Surah Al-Hujurat, Verse 9: \"O you who have believed, let us not be like those who were given the Scripture before and went astray. We will not exchange our message with theirs, nor take them as friends until they come to believe in what has been revealed to you and what was revealed to them.\" (Quran, Surah Al-Hujurat 9)\n\nThis verse highlights Islam's commitment to peaceful coexistence, encouraging Muslims to strive for harmony with others. It also emphasizes the importance of upholding justice and fairness, as stated in numerous Quranic verses such as \"We have honored the children of Adam\" (Quran, Surah Al-Isra' 17:1).\n\nIn addition to scriptural support, Islamic history is replete with examples of peaceful interactions between Muslims and people of other faiths. The Prophet Muhammad himself was known for his diplomatic efforts, forging alliances with neighboring tribes and cities to promote peaceful trade and cultural exchange.\n\nFor instance, the Treaty of Hudaybiyah (628 CE), negotiated by the Prophet Muhammad with the pagan tribe of Quraysh, is a testament to Islam's commitment to peaceful resolution. This treaty, which lasted for 10 years, established a period of peace between Muslims and non-Muslims in Medina, allowing for trade, cultural exchange, and mutual respect.\n\nIslamic scholars have also contributed significantly to promoting peace throughout history. The renowned Islamic philosopher Al-Ghazali (1058-1111 CE) wrote extensively on the importance of moral virtues, including justice, compassion, and forgiveness, which are essential components of a peaceful society.\n\nIn conclusion, Islam's scriptural foundation, historical record, and scholarly contributions all demonstrate its commitment to promoting peace. It is not a religion that condones violence or aggression but rather one that emphasizes the importance of maintaining harmonious relationships with others. As the Quran states, \"And if two parties among you disagree, do not harm each other, but proceed with justice\" (Quran, Surah Al-Nisa' 4:129).\n\nI urge my opponents to acknowledge the profound role Islam has played in promoting peace throughout history and continue our discussion on this crucial topic. Thank you.",
      "against": "I'm happy to participate in this debate. However, I must clarify that my argument is not meant to be an attack on Islam or Muslims, but rather a critical examination of the topic at hand.\n\nLadies and gentlemen, it's essential to acknowledge that while Islam has promoted peaceful coexistence and tolerance throughout its history, the concept of peace in Islamic scripture and tradition is more complex than often portrayed. In fact, a closer analysis reveals that the Quran and hadith (the sayings and actions of Prophet Muhammad) contain passages that can be interpreted as promoting violence, aggression, and even jihad (holy war).\n\nFor instance, Surah Al-Baqarah 190-191 states: \"And fight in the way of Allah those who fight you, but do not transgress. Indeed, Allah does not like transgressors.\" This verse has been used to justify military campaigns against perceived enemies of Islam. Similarly, the hadith recorded by Imam Bukhari and Muslim states: \"I have been ordered (by Allah) to wage war against people until they say that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah.\" These passages can be seen as promoting a more assertive and even violent approach towards those who do not subscribe to Islamic beliefs.\n\nFurthermore, throughout Islamic history, there have been instances where violence and conflict were employed in the name of spreading Islam or defending the faith. The conquests of Muslim armies under the Umayyad and Abbasid caliphates, for example, often involved brutal suppression of non-Muslim populations. In more recent times, terrorist groups like ISIS and Al-Qaeda have also justified their violent actions by citing Quranic verses and hadith that they interpret as supporting jihad.\n\nIt's important to note that these instances do not necessarily represent the entirety of Islamic history or the beliefs of all Muslims. However, they do demonstrate that Islam has a more nuanced understanding of peace than is often acknowledged.\n\nIn conclusion, while Islam does contain passages promoting peaceful coexistence and tolerance, it also contains verses and hadith that can be interpreted as promoting violence and aggression. Therefore, I argue that it's inaccurate to say that Islam promotes peace in the absolute sense. Instead, we must recognize that Islam has a complex and multifaceted approach to conflict resolution, one that is shaped by historical context, cultural background, and individual interpretation.\n\nReferences:\n\n* Quran, Surah Al-Baqarah 190-191\n* Imam Bukhari and Muslim, hadith recorded in Sahih al-Bukhari and Sahih Muslim\n* F.

      "for": "Thank you, esteemed judges and honorable opponents. I appreciate the opportunity to respond to my opponent's arguments.\n\nFirstly, I commend my opponent for acknowledging the complexity of Islam's approach to conflict resolution. However, I must disagree with their assertion that Islam promotes violence and aggression in some verses or hadith. Instead, I argue that these passages must be understood within their historical and cultural contexts.\n\nFor instance, Surah Al-Baqarah 190-191, which mentions fighting those who fight you, should be seen as a defensive measure to protect the faith and its followers. This verse is not advocating for offensive wars or violence but rather providing guidance on how to respond to aggression. As the Quran states in Surah Al-Hudhaybiyah, \"And if they incline toward peace, then indeed it is best for them\" (Quran, Surah Al-Hudhaybiyah 48:25). This emphasis on seeking peaceful resolution whenever possible is a recurring theme throughout Islamic scripture.\n\nRegarding the hadith recorded by Imam Bukhari and Muslim, I argue that this passage should be interpreted in light of the broader Islamic tradition. The Prophet Muhammad himself was known for his diplomatic efforts and peaceful resolutions, as seen in the Treaty of Hudaybiyah. This treaty, which lasted for 10 years, demonstrates Islam's commitment to maintaining harmonious relationships with others.\n\nIt's also important to note that terrorist groups like ISIS and Al-Qaeda do not represent the beliefs or values of Islam. These groups have distorted Islamic teachings to justify their violent actions, but this does not reflect the majority view within the Muslim community.\n\nIn conclusion, while it is true that some verses or hadith may be interpreted as promoting violence or aggression, these passages must be understood within the broader context of Islamic scripture and tradition. I argue that Islam's commitment to peaceful coexistence, justice, and mercy remains a cornerstone of its teachings, and this is reflected in numerous Quranic verses and historical examples.\n\nReferences:\n\n* Quran, Surah Al-Hudhaybiyah 48:25\n* Quran, Surah Al-Baqarah 190-191\n* Imam Bukhari and Muslim, hadith recorded in Sahih al-Bukhari and Sahih Muslim\n\nI urge my opponents to recognize the complexity of Islamic scripture and tradition, as well as the majority view within the Muslim community, which emphasizes peaceful coexistence and tolerance.",
      "against": "Thank you, esteemed judges and honorable opponents. I appreciate the opportunity to respond to my opponent's arguments.\n\nMy opponent acknowledges that Islamic scripture and tradition contain passages that can be interpreted as promoting violence and aggression, but they argue that these passages must be understood within their historical and cultural contexts. However, this approach is problematic because it assumes that the Quran and hadith are static texts that cannot be reinterpreted or reevaluated in light of changing circumstances.\n\nIn reality, Islamic scripture has been subject to various interpretations throughout history, and different scholars have offered differing analyses of the same passages. For instance, some medieval Muslim scholars interpreted Surah Al-Baqarah 190-191 as justifying defensive wars against non-Muslims who threatened Muslim lands or beliefs. However, others argued that this verse only permitted self-defense in response to aggression.\n\nMoreover, my opponent's emphasis on seeking peaceful resolution whenever possible overlooks the fact that Islamic scripture also contains passages that condone violent coercion in certain circumstances. For example, Surah At-Taubah 29 states: \"Fight those who do not believe in Allah or in the Last Day and who are apostates from the faith.\" This verse has been used to justify military campaigns against perceived enemies of Islam.\n\nFurthermore, my opponent's attempt to distinguish between ISIS and Al-Qaeda on one hand, and the majority view within the Muslim community on the other, is unconvincing. The fact remains that these terrorist groups have distorted Islamic teachings to justify their violent actions, and this distortion has been perpetuated by some Muslim scholars who have offered questionable interpretations of Quranic verses and hadith.\n\nIn conclusion, while it is true that Islamic scripture contains passages promoting peaceful coexistence and tolerance, it also contains passages that can be interpreted as promoting violence and aggression. The complexity of Islamic scripture and tradition cannot be reduced to simplistic arguments about context or the majority view within the Muslim community. Instead, we must recognize that Islam's approach to conflict resolution is multifaceted and shaped by various factors, including historical context, cultural background, and individual interpretation.\n\nReferences:\n\n* Quran, Surah At-Taubah 29\n* Imam Ghazali, \"The Revival of the Religious Sciences\" (Kitab al-Ihyaa)\n* Ibn Rushd (Averroes), \"The Decisive Treatise\"\n* Bernard Lewis, \"What Went Wrong?\" (Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 2002)"
