      "for": "Ladies and gentlemen, my esteemed opponents, I am here today to argue in favor of the proposition that Islam promotes violence towards non-Muslims. This is a topic that has stirred political and social debates for centuries, and unfortunately, the evidence is clear - there are numerous teachings within Islamic texts that encourage and justify violence against non-Muslims.\n\nOne need not look far to find examples of violence perpetrated in the name of Islam. The Quran itself contains verses that call for the punishment of unbelievers, such as Surah 9:29 which states: \"Fight those who do not believe in Allah or in the Last Day and who do not consider unlawful what Allah and His Messenger have made unlawful and who do not adopt the religion of truth from those who were given the Scripture - [fight] until they give the jizyah willingly while they are humbled.\"\n\nFurthermore, the Hadith, sayings and actions of the Prophet Muhammad, also contain instances where violence against non-Muslims is endorsed. For example, Sahih Muslim narrates a hadith in which the Prophet said \"I have been commanded to fight against people till they testify that there is no god but Allah, that Muhammad is the messenger of Allah, and they establish prayer and pay Zakat.\"\n\nThese teachings, coupled with the actions of extremist groups such as ISIS and Al-Qaeda who claim to be acting in the name of Islam, serve as clear evidence that there is a violent streak within the religion that cannot be ignored.\n\nIn conclusion, I urge you to consider these examples and acknowledge that there is a strong connection between Islam and the promotion of violence towards non-Muslims. Only by recognizing this can we work towards finding solutions to combat extremism and promote peace and understanding among all peoples. Thank you.\n\nCitations:\n1. Quran 9:29\n2.

      "against": "Ladies and gentlemen,\n\nI stand here today to argue against the notion that Islam promotes violence towards non-Muslims. This misconception is not only harmful but also misrepresents the teachings of Islam. Islam, like many other religions, preaches peace, tolerance, and respect for all individuals regardless of their faith.\n\nOne of the fundamental principles of Islam is the concept of \"jihad,\" which is often misunderstood as promoting violence. However, the term \"jihad\" actually encompasses a much broader meaning, including the personal struggle to maintain faith, the struggle against evil, and the effort to promote social justice. In fact, the Quran explicitly prohibits aggression and violence against non-Muslims, stating \"Fight in the cause of Allah those who fight you, but do not transgress limits; for Allah does not love transgressors\" (Quran 2:190).\n\nFurthermore, throughout Islamic history, there have been countless examples of coexistence and harmony between Muslims and non-Muslims. The Prophet Muhammad himself signed treaties and agreements with non-Muslim communities, guaranteeing their protection and freedom to practice their own religion. This serves as a clear testament to the inclusive and peaceful nature of Islam.\n\nIn conclusion, it is important to recognize that Islam does not promote violence towards non-Muslims. Instead, it emphasizes compassion, tolerance, and understanding towards all individuals, regardless of their faith. Let us not succumb to stereotypes and misinformation, but rather strive for mutual respect and harmony among all people.\n\nThank you.\n\n(Citations:\n- The Quran, 2:190\n- \"The Life of Muhammad\" by Muhammad Husayn Haykal\n- \"The Covenants of the Prophet Muhammad with the Christians of the World\" by John Andrew Morrow)"

      "for": "Thank you for your arguments, however, I must respectfully disagree with your interpretation of Islam's teachings on violence towards non-Muslims. While it is true that Islam, like many religions, preaches peace and coexistence, it is also important to acknowledge that there are teachings within Islamic texts that can be interpreted as promoting violence against non-Muslims.\n\nYou mentioned the concept of \"jihad\" as a form of personal struggle and social justice. While this is true, it is also important to recognize that there are also interpretations of jihad that justify violence against non-believers. For example, in Sahih Bukhari, one of the most authentic collections of hadith, it is narrated that the Prophet Muhammad said, \"I have been ordered to fight against the people until they testify that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah and that Muhammad is Allah's Messenger...\"\n\nAdditionally, in Surah 9:5 of the Quran, known as the \"Verse of the Sword,\" it states, \"And when the sacred months have passed, then kill the polytheists wherever you find them and capture them and besiege them and sit in wait for them at every place of ambush.\" This verse is often cited by extremists to justify acts of violence against non-Muslims.\n\nFurthermore, while it is true that the Prophet Muhammad signed treaties and agreements with non-Muslim communities, it is also important to acknowledge that these agreements were sometimes broken or disregarded in favor of warfare. For example, the Treaty of Hudaybiyyah was eventually broken by the Muslims, leading to the conquest of Mecca.\n\nIn conclusion, while Islam may preach peace and tolerance, it is evident that there are teachings within Islamic texts that can be interpreted as promoting violence towards non-Muslims. It is crucial to address these problematic interpretations and work towards promoting a more inclusive and peaceful understanding of Islam. Thank you.\n\nCitations:\n- Sahih Bukhari, Book 2, Hadith 24\n- Quran 9:5",
      "against": "Thank you for your rebuttal. \n\nWhile it is true that there are interpretations of Islamic texts that suggest violence against non-Muslims, it is crucial to understand these teachings in their proper historical and contextual framework. In the case of Sahih Bukhari and the Hadith you mentioned, it is important to consider the specific circumstances under which these statements were made. The notion of fighting against the people until they testify to the oneness of Allah can be seen as a response to the persecution faced by early Muslims in Mecca, rather than a general call for violence against all non-Muslims.\n\nSimilarly, the \"Verse of the Sword\" in Surah 9:5 needs to be understood within the context of self-defense and retaliation against those who violate treaties and attack the Muslim community. It is not a blanket command to kill all non-Muslims, but rather a directive to respond to aggression in a time of conflict.\n\nRegarding the Treaty of Hudaybiyyah, it is true that the agreement was eventually broken, but it is important to note that this was due to the violations committed by the Quraysh tribe, who attacked Muslim allies. The breaking of the treaty was a response to ongoing hostility, rather than an act of aggression.\n\nIn conclusion, while there are interpretations of Islamic texts that can be used to justify violence, it is essential to understand these teachings within their historical context and to promote a more nuanced and peaceful understanding of Islam. Let us focus on the broader message of compassion, tolerance, and coexistence that is central to the teachings of Islam.\n\n(Citations: \n- Understanding Hadith: Essays on The Arabian Nights and the Quran by Ramon Harvey\n- An Introduction to Quranic and Prophetic Translation by Usama Arif)"

      "for": "In conclusion, the debate on whether Islam promotes violence towards non-Muslims is a complex and contentious issue. While it is true that Islam preaches peace, compassion, and coexistence, it is also important to acknowledge the existence of teachings within Islamic texts that can be interpreted as promoting violence against non-Muslims. The examples of verses from the Quran and hadiths from the Prophet Muhammad that justify acts of violence against non-believers cannot be ignored.\n\nIt is crucial for us to address these problematic interpretations and work towards promoting a more inclusive and peaceful understanding of Islam. By acknowledging and tackling the root causes of extremism and violence in the name of religion, we can strive towards a world where mutual respect, understanding, and harmony prevail among all individuals, regardless of their faith. Thank you.",
      "against": "In conclusion, it is evident that Islam does not promote violence towards non-Muslims. While there are interpretations of Islamic texts that can be misconstrued as advocating violence, it is crucial to understand these teachings within their historical and contextual framework. The concept of jihad, the \"Verse of the Sword,\" and the broken treaties must be viewed in light of self-defense, response to aggression, and specific circumstances rather than as universal commands for violence.\n\nIslam, like many religions, emphasizes peace, tolerance, and respect for all individuals regardless of their faith. It is essential to promote a more inclusive and peaceful understanding of Islam, focusing on the broader message of compassion, tolerance, and coexistence. Let us strive for mutual respect and harmony among all people, rejecting stereotypes and misinformation, and working towards a world of understanding and unity. Thank you."
