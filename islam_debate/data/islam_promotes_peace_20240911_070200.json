      "for": "Opening Argument:\n\nLadies and gentlemen, I stand before you today to argue that Islam, at its core, is a religion that promotes peace. Despite misconceptions and the actions of a minority of extremists, the fundamental teachings of Islam emphasize harmony, compassion, and peaceful coexistence.\n\nFirst, it's crucial to understand that the very word \"Islam\" is derived from the Arabic root \"salama,\" which means peace, purity, submission, and obedience [1]. This etymological foundation underpins the entire faith, demonstrating that peace is central to Islamic ideology.\n\nThe Quran, Islam's holy book, repeatedly emphasizes the importance of peace. For instance, it states: \"O you who have believed, enter into peace completely\" (Quran 2:208) [2]. This verse clearly calls on Muslims to embrace peace in all aspects of their lives.\n\nFurthermore, Islamic teachings strongly condemn violence and promote forgiveness. The Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, said: \"The strong is not the one who overcomes the people by his strength, but the strong is the one who controls himself while in anger\" [3]. This hadith encourages self-control and peaceful resolution of conflicts, rather than resorting to violence.\n\nIslam also teaches respect for diversity and peaceful coexistence with people of other faiths. The Quran states: \"There shall be no compulsion in religion\" (Quran 2:256) [2], emphasizing freedom of belief and rejecting forced conversion.\n\nMoreover, Islamic history provides numerous examples of peaceful coexistence and tolerance. During the Islamic Golden Age, Muslims, Christians, and Jews lived together harmoniously in many parts of the Islamic world, contributing to advancements in science, philosophy, and the arts [4].\n\nIn conclusion, while it's true that some individuals have misinterpreted or misused Islamic teachings to justify violence, this goes against the fundamental principles of the religion. Islam, when understood and practiced correctly, is a faith that promotes peace, tolerance, and harmonious coexistence. It is our duty to recognize and emphasize these core values, fostering understanding and unity in our diverse world.\n\nCitations:\n\n[1] Esposito, J. L. (2003). The Oxford Dictionary of Islam.

      "against": "Here is a possible opening argument against the proposition that \"Islam promotes peace,\" along with some relevant citations:\n\n\"While Islam, like many religions, contains teachings about peace, there are aspects of Islamic doctrine and history that make it difficult to claim that Islam as a whole promotes peace. The Quran and Hadith contain numerous passages calling for violence against non-believers and apostates. For example, Quran 9:5 states 'fight and slay the pagans wherever ye find them.' Islamic law (Sharia) prescribes harsh punishments including death for apostasy and blasphemy. Throughout history, Islamic empires expanded largely through military conquest. Today, Islamist extremist groups continue to cite religious justification for violence. While many Muslims are peaceful, these problematic elements within Islam's core texts and historical practice make it challenging to argue that Islam inherently promotes peace.\"\n\nCitations:\n1.

      "for": "Thank you for presenting your perspective. While I acknowledge the points you've raised, I believe they require further context and a more nuanced understanding of Islamic teachings and history. Allow me to address these concerns and reinforce the argument that Islam, at its core, promotes peace.\n\nFirstly, it's crucial to understand that cherry-picking verses from religious texts without proper context can lead to misinterpretations. The verse you cited (Quran 9:5) is often taken out of context. When read in full context, it becomes clear that this verse refers to a specific historical situation and is not a general command [1]. Islamic scholars emphasize that such verses must be understood within their historical and textual context.\n\nRegarding Islamic law, it's important to note that interpretations of Sharia vary widely among Muslim scholars and communities. Many contemporary Islamic scholars argue for more progressive interpretations that align with modern human rights standards [2]. The ongoing debates and reforms within Islamic jurisprudence demonstrate the dynamic nature of Islamic thought and its capacity for peaceful adaptation to changing times.\n\nWhile it's true that Islamic empires expanded through military conquest, this was not unique to Islam but was a common practice of empires throughout history. Moreover, many of these conquests were followed by periods of relative peace and cultural flourishing, such as the Convivencia in medieval Spain, where Muslims, Christians, and Jews coexisted productively [3].\n\nRegarding extremist groups, it's crucial to understand that they represent a tiny minority of Muslims and their actions are consistently condemned by mainstream Muslim leaders and organizations worldwide [4]. These groups often arise from complex political and socio-economic factors rather than purely religious motivations.\n\nIslam's promotion of peace is evident in its emphasis on conflict resolution, forgiveness, and social justice. The Quran states: \"The servants of the Most Merciful are those who walk upon the earth in humility, and when the ignorant address them, they say words of peace\" (Quran 25:63) [5]. This verse, among many others, encourages peaceful interaction even in the face of hostility.\n\nFurthermore, Islamic ethics strongly emphasize the sanctity of human life. The Quran declares: \"...if anyone slays a human being unless it be [in punishment] for murder or for spreading corruption on earth - it shall be as though he had slain all mankind; whereas, if anyone saves a life, it shall be as though he had saved the lives of all mankind\" (Quran 5:32) [5].\n\nIn conclusion, while acknowledging the complexities in Islamic history and texts, the fundamental teachings of Islam promote peace, compassion, and justice. The actions of a minority should not overshadow the peaceful beliefs and practices of the vast majority of Muslims worldwide.\n\nCitations:\n[1] Afsaruddin, A. (2013).

      "against": "Thank you for your thoughtful response. While I appreciate the nuanced perspective you've presented, I must respectfully disagree with several key points and maintain my position that it is challenging to claim that Islam, as a whole, promotes peace.\n\n1. Contextual interpretation: While it's true that context is important when interpreting religious texts, the fact remains that numerous verses in the Quran and Hadith can be and have been interpreted to justify violence. Even when considering context, many of these passages remain problematic. For instance, the Quran 9:29 states: \"Fight those who do not believe in Allah or in the Last Day and who do not consider unlawful what Allah and His Messenger have made unlawful and who do not adopt the religion of truth from those who were given the Scripture - [fight] until they give the jizyah willingly while they are humbled.\" This verse, even in context, appears to promote aggression against non-Muslims [1].\n\n2. Sharia Law: While interpretations of Sharia may vary, many mainstream interpretations still include elements that are incompatible with modern concepts of human rights and peace. For example, apostasy remains punishable by death in several Muslim-majority countries [2]. The very existence of such laws creates an environment of fear and coercion, which is antithetical to peace.\n\n3. Historical context: While it's true that many empires expanded through conquest, the Islamic concept of jihad provided a unique religious justification for warfare that continues to influence modern conflicts. The early Islamic conquests were often accompanied by forced conversions and the imposition of discriminatory policies on non-Muslims [3].\n\n4. Extremist groups: While these groups may represent a minority, their ability to recruit and operate within Muslim communities suggests that their interpretations resonate with a non-trivial portion of the Muslim population. A 2013 Pew Research study found that significant percentages of Muslims in several countries believe that suicide bombings can be justified [4].\n\n5. Peaceful verses: While the Quran does contain peaceful verses, the principle of abrogation in Islamic jurisprudence suggests that later, more militant verses take precedence over earlier, more peaceful ones [5]. This creates a theological framework that can be used to justify violence.\n\n6. Treatment of non-Muslims: While Islamic ethics may emphasize the sanctity of human life, this often applies differently to Muslims and non-Muslims. The concept of dhimmitude, while historically offering some protections to non-Muslims, also institutionalized their second-class status in Islamic societies [6].\n\nIn conclusion, while many Muslims interpret their faith peacefully, the problematic elements within Islamic doctrine, law, and historical practice make it difficult to argue that Islam, as a comprehensive system, promotes peace.\n\nCitations:\n[1] Quran 9:29\n[2] Pew Research Center.

      "for": "Concluding Statement:\n\nLadies and gentlemen, throughout this debate, we have explored the complex and often misunderstood relationship between Islam and peace. I stand firm in my conviction that Islam, at its core, is a religion that promotes peace, harmony, and compassion.\n\nWe have examined several key points that support this position:\n\n1. The etymological roots of the word \"Islam\" itself, which means peace and submission to God.\n\n2. Numerous Quranic verses and Prophetic traditions that explicitly call for peace, tolerance, and peaceful coexistence.\n\n3. The importance of understanding religious texts in their proper historical and textual context, rather than cherry-picking isolated verses.\n\n4. The dynamic nature of Islamic jurisprudence, which allows for progressive interpretations aligned with contemporary human rights standards.\n\n5. Historical examples of peaceful coexistence and cultural flourishing under Islamic rule, such as the Convivencia in medieval Spain.\n\n6. The strong condemnation of extremist actions by mainstream Muslim leaders and organizations worldwide.\n\n7. Islam's emphasis on conflict resolution, forgiveness, and the sanctity of human life.\n\nWhile acknowledging the complexities in Islamic history and the misuse of religious teachings by a small minority, we must not lose sight of the peaceful beliefs and practices upheld by the vast majority of the world's 1.8 billion Muslims.\n\nIn our increasingly diverse and interconnected world, it is crucial that we foster understanding and recognize the peace-promoting aspects of Islam. By doing so, we can build bridges between communities, combat misconceptions, and work together towards a more harmonious global society.\n\nIslam's message of peace is not just a theological concept but a practical guide for millions of Muslims worldwide who strive daily to embody these principles in their interactions with others, regardless of faith or background.\n\nIn conclusion, when we examine Islam's foundational teachings, its ethical principles, and the lived experiences of most Muslims, it becomes clear that Islam does indeed promote peace. It is our responsibility to highlight these positive aspects, foster interfaith dialogue, and work collectively towards a more peaceful and understanding world.\n\nThank you.",
      "against": "Here is a possible concluding statement summarizing the position against the proposition that \"Islam promotes peace\":\n\nIn conclusion, while acknowledging that many Muslims interpret and practice their faith peacefully, the evidence presented throughout this debate makes it difficult to claim that Islam as a whole promotes peace.

Treatment of non-Muslims: Historical and contemporary practices in many Islamic societies have institutionalized unequal treatment of non-Muslims, challenging the notion of universal peace promotion.\n\nWhile recognizing the peaceful beliefs and practices of many Muslims, these fundamental issues within Islamic doctrine, law, and historical practice make it challenging to argue that Islam inherently promotes peace. A more nuanced view acknowledges both the peaceful and problematic aspects of this complex religion."
