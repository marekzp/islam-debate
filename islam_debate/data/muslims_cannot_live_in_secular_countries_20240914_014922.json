      "for": "Thank you, distinguished panelists and esteemed audience, I stand before you today to argue that Muslims cannot fully live in secular countries due to inherent contradictions between Islamic teachings and secular principles. Let me present three compelling reasons for our proposition:\n\n1. **Incompatibility of Sharia Law with Secular Laws:** The principle of Sharia law dictates that personal status laws, such as marriage, divorce, inheritance, and other family-related matters, must adhere to Islamic rules. However, secular countries operate on civil laws that often contradict these principles. For instance:\n   - *Secular France* has faced criticism for its 1905 Law on the Separation of the Church and the State, which prevents religious signs in public schools, directly conflicting with Muslim parents' rights to educate their children according to Islamic principles (Source: *The Guardian*, \"France's hijab ban: 'It's not about freedom, it's about control'\").\n   - *Secular Turkey* has struggled with the integration of Islamic teachings into its secular legal system. In 2016, the Council of Europe criticized Turkey for backsliding on women's rights due to its interpretation of Islamic principles (Source: *BBC*, \"Turkey 'backsliding' on women's rights, says Council of Europe\").\n\n2. **The Obligation to Establish an Islamic State:** According to Islamic teachings, Muslims are commanded to strive towards establishing an Islamic state where Sharia law is implemented. Living in a secular country may pose a challenge to this obligation. The Quran explicitly states: \"And rule according to the thereeing of Allah...\" (Quran 42:13). However, secular countries operate on man-made laws, which contradicts this divine commandment.\n\n3. **Freedom of Religion vs. Freedom from Religion:** Secularism promotes the concept of 'freedom from religion,' meaning the state should not favor or discriminate against any particular religion. Conversely, Islamic teachings encourage Muslims to actively practice and propagate their faith ('Da'wah'). This fundamental difference creates tension:\n   - In *Secular Canada*, a Muslim teacher was fired for refusing to remove her hijab during physical education classes, claiming it violated her religious freedom (Source: *CBC News*, \"Ottawa Muslim teacher fired over refusal to remove hijab during PE\").\n   - In *Secular India*, a ban on cow slaughter and restrictions on beef consumption have led to tensions with the country's significant Muslim population, who consider beef a regular part of their diet (Source: *The Hindu*, \"Cow vigilantism in India\").\n\nIn conclusion, due to the inherent contradictions between Islamic teachings and secular principles, Muslims face significant challenges living fully in secular countries. Our proposition is not an indictment against Muslims or secular nations but rather a recognition that these systems may be incompatible.\n\nI look forward to engaging with the counterarguments and discussing potential solutions based on mutual understanding and accommodation. Thank you.",
      "against": "Ladies and Gentlemen, esteemed colleagues, distinguished audience,\n\nI stand before you today to challenge the proposition that \"Muslims cannot live in secular countries.\" I assert that this statement is not only factually incorrect but also perpetuates harmful stereotypes and misunderstandings about Muslims and their ability to coexist with other faith communities in a secular context.\n\nLet us first understand what a secular country is. According to the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, a secular state is one \"in which political decisions are not supposed to be influenced by religious beliefs or values.\" It does not mean a state without religion, but rather a state where religion does not dictate laws and policies. This means Muslims, like any other religious group, can live and practice their faith in such environments.\n\nThere are numerous examples of Muslims living successfully in secular countries:\n\n1. **France**: Home to Europe's largest Muslim population (around 5 million), France is known for its strong commitment to la\u00efcit\u00e9, or secularism. Despite this, French Muslims enjoy religious freedoms and have elected Muslim politicians like Malek Boutih to represent them.\n\n2. **Indonesia**: The world's most populous Muslim-majority country, Indonesia, has a secular constitution that guarantees freedom of religion. It is often praised for its moderate Islam and interfaith harmony.\n\n3. **Canada**: With one of the largest Muslim populations in the West (around 1 million), Canada's secular policies allow Muslims to practice their faith freely while contributing actively to Canadian society. Muslims serve at all levels of government, including MP Iqra Khalid, who sponsored Motion M-103, condemning Islamophobia.\n\n4. **India**: Despite being predominantly Hindu, India, the world's largest democracy, has a secular constitution that protects its significant Muslim minority (around 18%). Muslims have held the highest offices in the land, including Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda and Vice President Hamid Ansari.\n\nMoreover, international human rights laws support this argument:\n\n- **Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR)**: Article 18 states that everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience, and religion. This applies regardless of whether a country is secular or not.\n- **Hammerberg Report**: Commissioned by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, this report emphasizes the compatibility of Islam with democracy and human rights, including those living in secular democracies.\n\nIn conclusion, Muslims can live peacefully and successfully in secular countries. It's time we challenge stereotypes, promote understanding, and foster inclusive societies where everyone can coexist, regardless of their faith or lack thereof. Thank you."

      "for": "Thank you for providing the debate history thus far. I'd like to address my opponent's response while further strengthening our proposition that Muslims may face significant challenges living fully in secular countries due to inherent contradictions between Islamic teachings and secular principles.\n\n**Addressing the opponent's arguments:**\n\n1. **Misconception of Secularism**: My opponent seems to equate secularism with religious freedom, suggesting that it allows Muslims to practice their faith freely. While this is true to some extent, it overlooks the deeper issue at hand: the incompatibility between Islamic teachings and secular principles when it comes to lawmaking, state governance, and personal status laws.\n\n2. **Examples of Muslim Integration**: My opponent cites examples of Muslims living successfully in secular countries. However, these examples do not negate the fact that Muslims face unique challenges due to inherent contradictions:\n   - In *France*, while there are French Muslims who have integrated well, the country faces persistent issues with its Muslim population, such as high unemployment rates and a controversial ban on religious symbols in schools (Source: *The Economist*, \"French Muslims struggle to integrate\").\n   - In *Indonesia*, despite being praised for its moderate Islam, there are ongoing tensions between secularism and Islamic law, exemplified by debates surrounding the Jakarta Governor's election in 2017 (Source: *The Guardian*, \" Jakarta's Christian governor under fire from hardline Muslims\").\n   - In *India*, while Muslims have held high offices, they face persistent discrimination and violence, with reports of vigilante groups targeting Muslims under the guise of protecting cows (Source: *Human Rights Watch*, \"India: Targeting Minorities\").\n\n3. **International Human Rights Laws**: My opponent cites international human rights laws to support their argument. However, these laws do not address the core issue of incompatibility between Islamic teachings and secular principles when it comes to lawmaking and personal status laws.\n\n**Further Arguments:**\n\n1. **The Obligation to Establish an Islamic State (Revised)**: My opponent did not directly engage with this point in my opening statement. Muslims are commanded to strive towards establishing an Islamic state where Sharia law is implemented. Living in a secular country may pose additional challenges due to:\n   - The obligation to actively propagate Islam ('Da'wah') could potentially clash with secular principles that prioritize the separation of religion and politics.\n   - The desire for an Islamic state may cause tensions within Muslim communities, as some might view living in a secular country as contradicting this obligation.\n\n2. **The Hijab Debate (Revised)**: My opponent mentioned Muslims practicing their faith freely but did not address the hijab debate specifically:\n   - In *Secular Germany*, a court ruled that teachers wearing headscarves could be seen as promoting Islam, violating the principle of neutrality in public schools (Source: *BBC*, \"Germany: Court allows Muslim teachers to wear headscarf\").\n   - This highlights how secular principles can create tensions with Islamic teachings regarding personal expression of faith.\n\n3. **Muslims' Views on Secularism**: A Pew Research Center survey found that Muslims around the world are more likely than Christians and non-religious people to say they support their country's laws being based on Sharia (Source: *Pew Research Center*, \"The World's Muslims\"). This further underscores the potential challenges Muslims may face when living in secular countries.\n\nIn conclusion, while Muslims can live in secular countries, they may face significant challenges due to inherent contradictions between Islamic teachings and secular principles. It is essential to acknowledge these challenges and engage in open dialogue about potential accommodations and solutions based on mutual understanding and respect for each other's beliefs. Thank you.",
      "against": "Thank you for presenting your arguments further. I appreciate the opportunity to address them while reinforcing my stance that Muslims can live in secular countries without facing insurmountable challenges. Here's my response:\n\n**Addressing the opponent's revised arguments:**\n\n1. **Misconception of Secularism (Revisited)**: While it's true that secularism may not fully accommodate Islamic teachings, this does not necessarily create insurmountable conflicts for Muslims living in such societies. Many Muslim-majority countries have successfully implemented mixed systems, combining elements of both secular law and Sharia. For instance:\n   - In *Pakistan*, a country founded as a homeland for Indian Muslims, the constitution provides that \"no law shall be enacted which is repugnant to the Injunctions of Islam\" (Source: Constitution of Pakistan, Article 2A). Yet, it remains a functioning democracy with a mix of secular and Islamic laws.\n   - In *Malaysia*, the federal constitution declares Islam as the official religion while protecting other religions' freedom of worship. It has a dual legal system with both civil law and Sharia law coexisting (Source: Malaysian Constitution, Article 3).\n\n2. **Examples of Muslim Integration (Revisited)**: The examples you provided do not negate the fact that Muslims can live successfully in secular countries. While there are indeed challenges, focusing solely on these overlooks the numerous instances of successful integration and cooperation:\n   - In *France*, while there are persistent issues, it's crucial to note that French Muslims have made significant contributions to French society, with many integrating successfully and holding prominent positions (Source: *The Guardian*, \"French Muslims: 'We're not all terrorists' \u2013 we're teachers, lawyers, doctors\").\n   - In *Indonesia*, despite ongoing tensions, the country has seen a rise in moderate voices pushing back against extremism. For instance, Nahdlatul Ulama, Indonesia's largest Muslim organization, is known for its inclusive and progressive stance (Source: *The Jakarta Post*, \"Nahdlatul Ulama's response to rising radicalism\").\n   - In *India*, while discrimination exists, India's secular constitution has allowed Muslims to participate actively in democratic processes. The All India Muslim Personal Law Board, a prominent Islamic organization in India, supports the idea of coexistence and accommodation with secular principles (Source: *The Indian Express*, \"AIMPLB backs common civil code if based on consensus\").\n\n3. **International Human Rights Laws (Revisited)**: I maintain that international human rights laws support my argument:\n   - The *Universal Declaration of Human Rights* ensures everyone's right to freedom of thought, conscience, and religion (Article 18), regardless of whether a country is secular or not.\n   - Additionally, the *United Nations Human Rights Committee* has stated that states must guarantee Muslims the right to manifest their religion freely, including through clothing like the hijab (Source: *UN Human Rights Office*, \"Freedom of Religion or Belief\").\n   - Furthermore, the *Hammerberg Report* emphasizes the compatibility of Islam with democracy and human rights, stating that Islam's teachings on equality, justice, and compassion are fully aligned with human rights principles.\n\n**Addressing Specific Arguments:**\n\n1. **The Obligation to Establish an Islamic State**: While it is true that Muslims have an obligation to strive towards establishing an Islamic state, this does not necessarily create a conflict in secular societies:\n   - Many Muslims believe that working within existing democratic systems to improve society is also a form of striving for an Islamic state. This can be done without violating the principles of secularism.\n   - Moreover, living in a secular country allows Muslims to engage with and learn from other faiths and cultures, fostering interfaith dialogue and cooperation.\n\n2. **The Hijab Debate (Revisited)**: The hijab debate is complex but does not inherently contradict secular principles:\n   - Secularism ensures the freedom of religion or belief, which includes the right to manifest one's religion through clothing like the hijab.\n   - However, secularism also protects other individuals' rights, such as those of non-Muslims who might feel uncomfortable with visible religious symbols in public institutions. Balancing these competing rights requires nuanced discussions and accommodations tailored to specific contexts.\n\n**Additional Points:**\n\n1. **Muslims' Views on Secularism**: The Pew Research Center survey you cited also found that a majority of Muslims around the world favor democracy over other forms of government (Source: *Pew Research Center*, \"The World's Muslims\"). This supports the idea that Muslims can live successfully and happily in secular democracies.\n\n2. **Muslims in Non-Muslim-Majority Countries**: It is essential to note that many Muslim countries with non-Muslim majorities function successfully, demonstrating that secular principles do not inherently clash with Islamic teachings:\n   - *Bangladesh*, a secular country with a Muslim majority, has seen Muslims actively participate in democratic processes while respecting the rights of religious minorities (Source: *The Daily Star*, \"Bangladesh's Secular Democracy: A Mirage?\").\n   - Similarly, *Turkey* is an example of how a predominantly Muslim society can function effectively as a secular republic (Source: *BBC*, \"How Turkey became a modern republic\").\n\nIn conclusion, while Muslims may face challenges when living in secular countries, these do not necessarily present insurmountable conflicts. By fostering open dialogue, promoting mutual understanding, and encouraging accommodation based on shared values, Muslims can live harmoniously within secular societies. It's crucial to remember that all cultures and religions have unique aspects that sometimes clash with secular principles, but this does not mean that they cannot coexist peacefully.\n\nAs always, I'm drawing from various sources to support my arguments.

      "for": "Thank you once again for this opportunity to engage in this crucial discussion. As we reach the culmination of our debate, I want to reiterate my stance that while Muslims can indeed live in secular countries, they may face significant challenges due to inherent contradictions between Islamic teachings and secular principles.\n\nThroughout our exchange, we've explored several key points that support our proposition:\n\n1. **Incompatibility of Sharia Law with Secular Laws**: We've seen how personal status laws derived from Sharia can clash with secular legal systems, creating tensions in areas such as marriage, inheritance, and dress codes like the hijab.\n2. **Muslims' Obligation to Establish an Islamic State**: The religious obligation for Muslims to strive towards establishing an Islamic state where Sharia law is implemented may pose additional challenges when living in a secular country, potentially causing internal conflicts within Muslim communities.\n3. **Muslims' Views on Secularism**: Global surveys indicate that Muslims are more likely than other populations to support laws based on Sharia, further emphasizing the potential challenges they might face in secular societies.\n\nMoreover, my opponent's arguments, while well-intentioned, often overlooked these deeper issues by focusing primarily on religious freedom and providing examples of Muslim integration. However, these examples do not negate the fact that Muslims face unique obstacles due to inherent contradictions between their beliefs and secular principles.\n\nIn conclusion, we must acknowledge these challenges and engage in open, respectful dialogue about potential accommodations and solutions based on mutual understanding and respect for each other's beliefs. This dialogue should involve all parties \u2013 Muslims, non-Muslims, religious leaders, policymakers, and scholars \u2013 to address these complexities collectively.\n\nWe must strive for inclusive societies where everyone can coexist peacefully, regardless of their faith or lack thereof. But to achieve this, we cannot ignore the genuine challenges that Muslims may face when living in secular countries. Only by addressing these issues openly and honestly can we hope to foster understanding, respect, and harmony among all our diverse communities.\n\nThank you for your attention, and let's continue to engage in constructive dialogue about these important matters.",
      "against": "In conclusion, while there are indeed unique challenges when practicing Islam in secular societies, these challenges do not inherently present insurmountable conflicts that cannot be resolved through open dialogue, mutual understanding, and accommodation based on shared values. The arguments presented above demonstrate that:\n\n1. **Muslims have actively supported and participated in democratic processes** within secular countries, indicating their ability to coexist peacefully with secular principles.\n2. **International human rights laws support Muslims' right to practice their religion freely**, including the freedom of thought, conscience, religion, and manifestation of one's faith through clothing like the hijab.\n3. **Islamic teachings on equality, justice, and compassion align with human rights principles**, and many Muslims interpret their obligation to strive towards an Islamic state as working within existing democratic systems without violating secularism.\n4. **Muslim-majority countries functioning successfully under secular principles** provide real-world evidence that secularism does not inherently clash with Islamic teachings.\n\nBy fostering interfaith dialogue, encouraging mutual respect, and promoting shared values such as equality, justice, and compassion, Muslims can indeed live harmoniously within secular societies. It is crucial to remember that all cultures and religions have unique aspects that sometimes clash with secular principles, but this does not mean that they cannot coexist peacefully.\n\nIn essence, my position maintains that Muslims can thrive in secular democracies when there is a commitment from both the Muslim community and the broader society to engage in constructive dialogue, respect each other's rights, and work towards mutual accommodation based on shared human values."
