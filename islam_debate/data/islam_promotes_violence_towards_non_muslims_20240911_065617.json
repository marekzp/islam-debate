      "for": "Ladies and Gentlemen,\n\nI intend to shed light on an important and contentious matter today, but I would like to clarify from the outset that my argument does not aim to cast a blanket judgement upon the entirety of Islam or its followers, or to claim that every Muslim or Islamic entity condones or engages in violence. The focus of this debate is simply to critically examine whether some tenets of Islam are interpreted in such a way that they promote violence towards non-Muslims.\n\nTo begin with, there is evidence to suggest that certain verses and Hadiths within Islamic scripture, especially those from the Medina period, may be weaponized by radical ideologists. The 'Verse of the Sword' in the Quran, surah 9:5 for instance, could be construed as promoting violence: \"But when the forbidden months are past, then fight and slay the Pagans wherever ye find them\". However, as we know, interpretation is everything (Quran, 9:5).\n\nThe Hadiths, or sayings of Prophet Muhammad, likewise have quotes which may be perceived as promoting violence. For instance, Sahih Bukhari, in Volume 4, Book 52, Hadith Number 220, Prophet Muhammad reportedly professed: \"I have been made victorious with terror\". Evidently, the text could be interpreted as an indicator of violence (Sahih Bukhari, 4:52:220).\n\nSeveral Islamic scholars and critics have pointed out that such verses, taken out of context or interpreted in bile, provide a basis for fundamentalist and extremist factions to rationalize violence against non-Muslims. Terrorism expert Peter Bergen opines that Jihadist groups like Al-Qaeda quote certain violent portions of the Quran to legitimize their actions.\n\nAn article in the Princeton University Press Journal details how these verses may have been used by jihadists to validate terrorist attacks across the world, such as 9/11 and the Paris attacks in 2015 (Princeton University Press Journal, 2016).\n\nWhile there is no universal agreement on these interpretations, the misuse of such potentially violent scriptures by a select few should be addressed and acknowledged. We need to foster an understanding that allows for peace and coexistence, rather than violence and divisiveness.\n\nIn conclusion, while most practising Muslims do not resort to violence and are peace-loving, my argument is built fundamentally on the theoretical basis and specific interpretations of Islamic texts which, in certain circumstances, can promote violence towards non-Muslims. We should focus on de-radicalizing and correcting these interpretations, rather than ignoring the issue at hand.\n\nSources:\n- Quran 9:5.\n- Sahih Bukhari, 4:52:220.\n- Princeton University Press Journal, 2016.",
      "against": "Ladies and Gentlemen,\n\nMy position today is centered on understanding, tolerance, and the genuine essence of one of the world's largest religions, Islam. I stand here to debunk the stereotype that Islam promotes violence towards non-Muslims. This blanket stereotype is not only biased but equally unfair and has been largely formulated around misinterpretations, misunderstandings, and misinformation. \n\nThe Qur'an, which is the principal text of Islam, teaches peace, respect, and tolerance towards all, regardless of faith. One of the central tenets of Islam, encapsulated in Surah Al-Kafirun (109:6), articulates, 'To you, your religion, and to me, mine.' This respectfully acknowledges the existence of different beliefs and promotes the peaceful co-existence of all religions. \n\nMoreover, the claim that Islam endorses violence is decidedly contradicted by a verse found in the Qur'an: \"Whoever kills an innocent person, it is as if he has killed all humanity. And whoever saves a person, it is as if he has saved all humanity\" (5:32). This highlights Islam's profound reverence for human life, clearly demonstrating zero endorsement for violence.\n\nMoreover, the Prophet Muhammad's life provides vivid examples of tolerance towards non-Muslims. He is known for having signed treaties with other tribes and religious communities, including the Constitution of Medina - a clear embodiment of his principles of tolerance and peaceful co-existence (Lecker, 1990). \n\nIt is crucial to differentiate between the inherent teachings of a religion and the exploitation of its texts to justify personal actions or politics. Misinterpretations of textual works happen in every religion, yet it is crucial to remember that this does not equate to the actual teachings of the faith. Dr. John Andrew Morrow, a scholar of Islam, believes that \"Fundamentally, people are peaceful, and a small minority are waging war. Sadly, religion becomes an excuse, with both sides claiming God is on their side\" (2015). \n\nHence, generalizing the actions of a minority to the entire 1.8 billion Muslim population worldwide is not only unfair but factually incorrect. \n\nIn conclusion, while isolated passages from the Qur'an or actions of a small number of misinterpretations can be misused to suggest that Islam supports violence, a holistic understanding of Islam, its teachings, and its Prophet reveals an overriding message of peace, tolerance, and respect for all humanity.\n\nReferences:\n1.

      "for": "Ladies and Gentlemen,\n\nFirstly, I wish to acknowledge the validity of some of the points raised by my learned opponent. Islam, in the same way as several other religions, does indeed contain teachings promoting peace, respect and tolerance. Yet, this debate specifically engages with the question of whether Islamic texts and teachings could be, and indeed have been, interpreted to propose violence against non-Muslims.\n\nIn regard to your citation of Quranic verse 5:32 (Surah Al-Ma'idah), it is undoubtedly one of the most frequently quoted passages to exemplify Islam\u2019s inherent peace. However, this verse's origin and context are seldom mentioned. Originally it was not associated with Muslims but Jews, traced back to both the Talmud and the Jewish Mishnah - as reported by Rabbi Joseph Telushkin (Telushkin, 1991). The very next verse 5:33, adding to it, prescribes harsh punishments for \u2018those who wage war against Allah and His Messenger\u2019. This could feasibly be interpreted as an invitation to violence - as Warraq (2002) and Cook (2000) suggested in their writings.\n\nA contextualised understanding of the scripture thus reveals how any set of verses can be selectively interpreted to justify a range of actions - from peace to violence. Particularly, in real-world terms, if those verses were as definitively peaceful as you suggest, it would be both puzzling and disconcerting to see entities such as ISIS, Taliban and Al-Qaeda use the same Holy Book to justify their campaigns of terror.\n\nMoreover, the Constitution of Medina signed by Prophet Muhammad, which is said to embody principles of tolerance and peaceful co-existence needs to be considered relative to the practices of the Prophet. Noteworthy is the Battle of Tabouk where Prophet Muhammad reportedly waged war against Byzantine Christians whom he perceived as a potential threat, despite the absence of any provocation (Ibn Ishaq/Hisham, Sira, Pg. 289, 602).\n\nTo reiterate, our focus is not to condemn the entire religion of Islam or its followers, but to acknowledge the potential existence of interpretations promoting violence against non-Muslims, and endeavor to rectify them. The reality cannot be denied that there still are continuous interpretations of the Quran and Hadith by some individuals or groups, which have resulted in justifications for violence against non-Muslims.\n\nReferences:\n1.

      "against": "Ladies and Gentlemen,\n\nIt is true that selective interpretation of any religious text can lead to opposing views, but this is not the failing of the religion itself; rather, those who choose to misuse it. Hence, it remains critical that we do not confuse the misuse of texts with the inherent teachings of the religion.\n\nIn defense of Surah 5:32, despite originating in Jewish scriptures, it was not dismissed but reaffirmed in Islam, demonstrating a shared respect for human life. Moreover, Surah 5:33 - the subsequent verse which prescribes punishment for \u2018those who wage war against Allah and His Messenger\u2019 - needs to be interpreted in the correct context. This verse wasn\u2019t revealed as a call for unprovoked aggression, but as a defense mechanism when faced with a threat. It is essential to clarify that \u2018waging war\u2019 here signifies an act of aggression or violence initiated against the Muslim community.\n\nAsserting that groups like ISIS, Taliban, and Al Qaeda reflect every Muslim's belief is akin to suggesting that radical extremes in any religion reflect the thoughts of every one of their followers. Such groups represent a minute fraction of the Muslim population and are widely condemned by Muslims worldwide (Nacos & Torres-Reyna, 2007). Their actions go beyond the pale of Islam and violate direct commands against killing innocents, and spreading injustice and chaos. Their decontextualized and manipulative interpretation and propaganda does not validate the claim that Islam endorses violence.\n\nRegarding Prophet Muhammad's actions, historical instances like the Battle of Tabouk should not be isolated from their context. Admittedly, the Prophet did lead military campaigns, but they were in response to the threats and hostile actions towards the Muslim community, and not due to religious intolerance (Ramadan, 2007). Islam's early history was fraught with hostility and consistent attempts to eradicate the emerging faith along with its followers.\n\nIndeed, misinterpretations of the Quran and Hadith for justifications of violence against non-Muslims exist, but it's vital to remember that misinterpretations are not confined to Islam, but to all religions. It shows the distortion carried out by people with vested interests, not a failing of the religion itself.\n\nLet us not confuse Islam, a religion, with some of its misguided followers. We need to differentiate between the religion itself, advocating peace and tolerance towards all, regardless of faith, and the decontextualized interpretations of a few individuals or radicalized groups.\n\nReferences:\n1.

    "conclusions": {
      "for": "Ladies and Gentlemen,\n\nIn sum, the motion we had to consider was not whether Islam, in its entirety, promotes violence, or whether all Muslims globally endorse or partake in violence. It was to critically explore whether specific interpretations of Islamic texts might incite violence against non-Muslims. We have provided examples from the Quran and Hadiths, demonstrated by radical factions and the scholarship of Islamic critics, that do support this proposition.\n\nWe have acknowledged and respect that Islam, like all religions, promotes messages of peace and tolerance. However, the tantalizing evidence showing potential for violence interpretation in Islamic texts cannot be disregarded either. The 'Verse of the Sword', Sahih Bukhari's Hadiths, and the presence of Jihad ideologies in notorious terrorist organizations like the Al-Qaeda and ISIS affirm this proposition.\n\nIn dissecting Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:32), we found out that independently, the verse symbolizes a commitment to life, but the subsequent context could be used for justifying violence. Moreover, Prophet Muhammad's actions, such as the Battle of Tabouk, highlight the potential for a belligerent interpretation of peace treaties like the Constitution of Medina.\n\nAs such, our argument stands firm - there is potential within the Islamic texts, as within many religious doctrines, to incite violence when interpreted in certain lenses. And as much as peace and tolerance are core pillars of Islam, these interpretations that have been utilized by a radical minority to promote violence do exist. Our aim moving forward should be to challenge and rectify these interpretations and foster understanding and peace among all religious affiliations.",
      "against": "Ladies and Gentlemen,\n\nTo conclude, we must always remember that the interpretation of religious texts, including the Quran, isn\u2019t uniformly binding upon its followers. Most of the Muslims around the world seek peace, respect, compassion and justice just like individuals of other faiths. The assertion that Islam promotes violence towards non-Muslims solely rests on the misinterpretations and misuse of selected textual instances devoid of their contextual backgrounds. The inherent teachings of Islam\u2014as exhibited in revered texts and as narrated in the life of the Prophet Muhammad\u2014articulate principles of tolerance, mutual respect, and the sanctity of human life. It's important not to let the distorted interpretations by a few radical factions to overshadow the peaceful co-existing majority.\n\nAs we move forward in this diverse world, it's important to rise above prejudices and stereotypes that unfairly stigmatize 1.8 billion people worldwide. We must instead, make an earnest attempt to understand different faiths, their teachings, and refrain from judging a religion based on the actions of a minority who distort its teachings for personal agendas. If we do this, we will realize that Islam, at its core, does not promote violence but cherishes peace, understanding, and respect for the dignity of all human beings, regardless of their faith. And this is the understanding we need to promote, for a more tolerant and peaceful world. Thank you."
