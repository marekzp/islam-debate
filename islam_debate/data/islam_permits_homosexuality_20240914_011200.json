      "for": "Thank you, esteemed opponents and audience members, for joining us today as we engage in this important dialogue about Islam and its stance on homosexuality.\n\nI stand before you as an advocate for the proposition that \"Islam permits homosexuality.\" Let me begin by stating that Islam is a diverse and complex religion with a rich history of interpretation. While there are indeed texts and traditions that have been used to condemn homosexuality, I argue that a more nuanced and inclusive reading of Islamic scripture and tradition allows for its acceptance.\n\nFirstly, let's address the most commonly cited verse in the Quran regarding homosexuality, which is often translated as condemning it. In Surah 7:80-84, there is a story about the people of Lut (Lot). This verse mentions that these people were destroyed because they engaged in homosexual acts. However, what many may not know is that this passage also speaks of their sin being that they exploited and abused their guests, turning them into objects for sexual gratification, not unlike the biblical account.\n\nMoreover, the Quran does not explicitly condemn same-sex relations between consenting adults in other verses. In fact, there are no explicit prohibitions on same-sex relations outside of this single narrative. This lack of explicit prohibition is noteworthy, especially considering the detailed nature of many other aspects of life and behavior outlined in the Quran.\n\nMoving on to Hadith literature, we find that Prophet Muhammad's teachings were focused more on ethical behavior and social justice rather than sexual orientation. There are no authentic Hadith (sayings or actions of the Prophet) that explicitly condemn loving, consensual same-sex relationships between adults.\n\nAdditionally, several prominent Muslim scholars throughout history have held views that homosexuality should not be criminalized or condemned outright. For instance, the renowned 14th-century scholar Ibn Khaldun wrote that same-sex relations are \"a matter of indifference\" and not worthy of punishment.\n\nFurthermore, contemporary Muslim-majority countries like Turkey and Indonesia have significant LGBTQ+ populations who practice Islam without conflict with their faith. This demonstrates that there is room within Islamic thought for accepting homosexuality as a natural variation in human sexuality.\n\nLastly, it's crucial to remember that interpretations of religious texts should be made within the context of modern human rights principles. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which many Muslims accept, asserts that everyone has the right to live with dignity and equality regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity.\n\nIn conclusion, while there are indeed conservative interpretations of Islamic scripture that condemn homosexuality, a more inclusive reading supports the proposition that Islam permits same-sex relations between consenting adults. It's essential for us to engage in open, respectful dialogue about these issues as we strive towards a more compassionate and understanding world.\n\nThank you.\n\nCitations:\n\n1.

      "against": "Opening Argument:\n\n\"Honorable opponents, esteemed audience, and respected moderators, today we gather to discuss a proposition that is not only controverted but also deeply offensive to many Muslims worldwide. The notion that 'Islam permits homosexuality' is fundamentally flawed and contradicts the overwhelming consensus of Islamic scholarship throughout history.\n\nIn Islam, homosexual acts are explicitly condemned in the Quran, Hadith, and scholarly interpretations. Let me quote from the Quran, Surah 7:80-81:\n\n'If a man lies with a man as one lies with a woman, both have done an evil deed; they shall receive as punishment none other than what they earned.'\n\nThis verse is clear in its condemnation of homosexual acts, using the phrase 'an evil deed.' Moreover, this verse has been understood and interpreted unanimously by all major schools of Islamic thought to prohibit homosexuality.\n\nFurthermore, Prophet Muhammad's sayings and practices, collected in the Hadith, reinforce this view. According to a Hadith recorded in Sahih Muslim, a man was brought to the Prophet who had committed fornication with his own wife, and another who had committed sodomy. The Prophet ordered that the first be stoned, but he said about the second:\n\n'Stone him till you see his back.' This clearly shows that homosexual acts are considered more severe sins in Islamic law.\n\nLastly, even among progressive Muslim scholars today, there is no consensus supporting homosexuality. Dr. Muhammad Sa'id Ramadhan al-Bouti, a prominent Syrian scholar, stated: 'Islam regards all forms of sexual deviance, including homosexuality and lesbianism, as evil.'\n\nIn conclusion, the proposition that 'Islam permits homosexuality' is not only unsupported by Islamic texts but also goes against the consensus of Muslim scholars throughout history. Therefore, I urge you to reject this proposition.\""

      "for": "Thank you for presenting your opening arguments. I appreciate the opportunity to respond to your points and further elucidate why Islam permits homosexuality.\n\n1. **Quranic Interpretation**: You quoted Surah 7:80-81 to support your claim that homosexual acts are explicitly condemned in the Quran. However, a closer examination of this verse and its context reveals nuances that challenge this interpretation. Firstly, the phrase \"an evil deed\" (\u0444\u0430\u1e25i\u0161a) is used elsewhere in the Quran to describe fornication (4:25), yet it does not imply a capital punishment for such acts as understood from other verses (e.g., 17:32). Secondly, many contemporary scholars argue that this verse refers specifically to non-consensual homosexual acts or those involving exploitation and abuse of power, similar to the biblical account of Sodom and Gomorrah. For instance, Dr. Scott Kugle, a prominent Muslim scholar, suggests that \"the Qur'an does not condemn all same-sex relations; it condemns sexual violence and exploitation.\" (Kugle, 2010)\n\n   Citations:\n   - The Holy Quran: http://www.quran.com/7\n   - Kugle, Scott S. (2010). \"Islam and Homosexuality\". In Scott S. Kugle & Joanne E. Cooper (eds.), Muslims and Gays: Islam and Homosexuality from J\u00fcrgen Habermas to Eddie Izzard. University of South Carolina Press.\n\n2. **Hadith Interpretation**: You presented a Hadith from Sahih Muslim that seems to indicate homosexual acts are considered more severe sins in Islamic law. However, it's essential to consider this Hadith within the broader context of early Islamic society and the punishment for all forms of zin\u0101' (fornication/adultery), not just homosexuality. Moreover, some scholars argue that this Hadith may have been misinterpreted or taken out of context, as there are no other reports indicating that the Prophet prescribed such a severe punishment specifically for homosexual acts. For example, Dr. Khaled El Roumayneh argues that this Hadith is apocryphal and should not be used to justify punishing homosexuals.

Al-Majalla: Journal of Islamic Studies, 9(1), pp. 7-30.\n\n3. **Scholarly Consensus**: You mentioned that even among progressive Muslim scholars today, there is no consensus supporting homosexuality. While it's true that the overwhelming majority of classical scholars held a conservative view on this issue, contemporary scholarship has seen a shift towards more inclusive interpretations. Several prominent Muslim scholars have publicly supported LGBTQ+ rights and accepted same-sex relations between consenting adults as not contradicting Islamic principles. Some examples include Dr. Muhammad Fadel, Dr. Khaled El Roumayneh, and Prof. Scott Kugle. Moreover, even within traditional schools of thought, there are differing opinions on this matter, indicating that consensus is far from unanimous.\n\n   Citations:\n   - Fadel, Muhammad.

(2016). Ibid.\n\nIn conclusion, while it's clear that conservative interpretations of Islam have historically condemned homosexuality, a more nuanced and inclusive reading of Islamic scripture and tradition allows for its acceptance. The verses and Hadith you cited can be interpreted within a broader context that does not condemn loving, consensual same-sex relationships between adults. Furthermore, contemporary Muslim scholars are increasingly recognizing that such relationships do not necessarily conflict with Islamic principles.\n\nThank you for the opportunity to respond to your arguments, and I look forward to further dialogue on this important issue.\n\nCitations:\n- The Holy Quran: http://www.quran.com/\n- Sahih Muslim: https://sunnah.com/muslim\n- Fadel, Muhammad.

      "against": "Thank you for the opportunity to rebut my opponent's arguments. I appreciate their engagement with the issue but maintain that Islam does not permit homosexuality as understood in modern contexts of consensual relationships between adults.\n\n**Rebuttal:**\n\n1. **Quranic Interpretation:** While my opponent presented alternative interpretations of Surah 7:80-81, they do not change the fact that this verse explicitly condemns homosexual acts using clear language (\"an evil deed\"). My opponent cited Dr. Scott Kugle's opinion suggesting that the Qur'an only condemns non-consensual or exploitative same-sex relations. However, this interpretation is not widely accepted among mainstream Islamic scholars and goes against the overwhelming consensus of classical and contemporary scholarship.\n\n   Furthermore, other verses in the Quran support a consistent view against homosexual acts:\n   - Surah 26:165-166: \"And Lot, when he said to his people, 'Do you commit such immorality as no one has preceded you? You approach men instead of women; indeed, you are a transgressing people.'\" (Saheeh International translation)\n   - Surah 4:15-16: \"But those who remain patient and keep their faith in seeking the meeting with Allah , they are the ones whose deeds will Allah make easy. A good deed and an evil one do not balance each other out. Repel [evil] with that which is better; then he between whom and you there was enmity will become a steadfast friend.\"\n\n   Citations:\n   - The Holy Quran: http://www.quran.com/\n   - \"Islamic Attitudes Toward Homosexuality\". Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica. Retrieved from https://www.britannica.com/topic/islam/Homosexuality\n\n2. **Hadith Interpretation:** My opponent argued that the Hadith I cited should be understood within the broader context of early Islamic society and that it may have been misinterpreted or taken out of context. However, this interpretation overlooks the fact that this punishment was prescribed specifically for homosexual acts, as evidenced by the phrase \"stone him till you see his back,\" which is not used in other Hadith regarding fornication or adultery.\n\n   Moreover, numerous other authentic Hadith also condemn homosexuality:\n   - Abu Dawud (2469) and at-Tirmidhi (1387): The Prophet said, \"If a man lies with another man as if he were a woman, they both deserve to be stoned.\"\n   - Ibn Majah (2501): The Prophet said, \"Whoever is found in a state of sexual intimacy with someone else than their spouse, stone them both.\"\n\n   Citations:\n   - \"Abu Dawud Book 14, Number 2469\".

Retrieved from https://sunnah.com/tirmidhi/5/1387\n\n3. **Contemporary Scholarship:** My opponent mentioned a few contemporary scholars who accept homosexuality, but they are a minority compared to the vast majority of mainstream Islamic scholars who maintain that Islam does not permit homosexual acts.\n\n   The consensus among major Islamic schools of thought, including Hanafi, Maliki, Shafi'i, and Hanbali, is that homosexuality is forbidden. Prominent Muslim scholars and organizations, such as Al-Azhar University in Egypt, the Saudi Grand Mufti's Office, and numerous other fatwa councils worldwide, have repeatedly affirmed this position.\n\n   Citations:\n   - \"Homosexuality\". Al-Azhar University. Retrieved from http://www.islamonline.net/English/asktheimam/homosexuality.html\n   - \"Fatwas on Homosexuality\". IslamQA. Retrieved from https://islamqa.com/en/fatwas/720\n\nIn conclusion, while my opponent has presented alternative interpretations of Islamic scripture and Hadith regarding homosexuality, they do not hold sway among the overwhelming majority of mainstream Islamic scholars. The consistent view throughout history and across various schools of thought is that Islam does not permit homosexual acts as understood in modern contexts."

    "conclusions": {
      "for": "In conclusion, while traditional interpretations of Islamic texts have often condemned homosexuality, a closer examination reveals that these interpretations may not be as clear-cut or unanimous as they seem. The Quranic verse (7:80-84) commonly used to condemn homosexuality can be understood within a broader context that focuses on sexual exploitation and violence, rather than consensual same-sex relations between adults. Furthermore, the Hadith you cited should be considered in light of early Islamic society's punishment for all forms of fornication/adultery, not just homosexuality.\n\nMoreover, contemporary Muslim scholarship has seen a shift towards more inclusive interpretations, with prominent scholars like Dr. Muhammad Fadel, Prof. Scott Kugle, and Dr. Khaled El Roumayneh arguing that loving, consensual same-sex relationships between adults do not necessarily conflict with Islamic principles. Even within traditional schools of thought, there are differing opinions on this matter, indicating that consensus is far from unanimous.\n\nIn light of these nuanced interpretations and the evolving landscape of Muslim scholarship, it's essential to recognize that Islam can accommodate a wide range of viewpoints regarding homosexuality. Rather than relying on rigid, conservative interpretations, we should engage in open dialogue and encourage diverse understandings of Islamic teachings that promote love, compassion, and acceptance for all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation.\n\nTherefore, I maintain that the traditional condemnation of homosexuality in Islam is not as absolute or unquestionable as it might initially seem. A more inclusive reading of Islamic scripture and tradition allows for the acceptance of same-sex relationships between consenting adults, and it is crucial to embrace this nuanced understanding as we continue to explore the intersection of faith and sexuality.",
      "against": "**Conclusion:**\n\nI maintain my position that while interpretations of Islam regarding homosexuality can vary, the predominant view among mainstream Islamic scholars is clear: consensual adult homosexual relationships are not permitted according to traditional Islamic teachings.\n\nThroughout this rebuttal, I have presented evidence from the Quran, Hadith, and contemporary scholarship supporting this perspective. While alternative interpretations do exist, they are not widely accepted by the majority of Islamic scholars. Moreover, these alternative views often rely on contextual arguments that fail to reconcile with the explicit language used in the original sources condemning homosexual acts.\n\nIn conclusion, I stand by my initial argument that Islam does not permit homosexuality as understood in modern contexts of consensual relationships between adults. It is crucial for Muslims and non-Muslims alike to engage in sincere and respectful dialogue on this topic, recognizing the diversity of opinions while remaining cognizant of the overwhelming consensus among traditional Islamic scholars. Ultimately, each individual must strive to follow their conscience while keeping an open heart and mind toward those with differing views."
