      "for": "Ladies and Gentlemen,\n\nToday we address an ongoing controversial topic- 'Does Islam permit homosexuality?' I argue that it does, and while this viewpoint might seem outlandish to many owing to traditionally accepted beliefs, let's delve deeper into this perspective.\n\nAlthough majority interpretations of the Qur'an, Hadiths, and Islamic jurisprudence often brand homosexuality as a sinful act, a growing number of scholars and activists argue that these interpretations are born from centuries of socio-cultural biases, not inherent mandates from the Qur'an. Let's dissect the foundations of these stances through the lens of understanding and compassion.\n\nCentral to Islam's teachings is compassion, pluralism, and respect for human dignity, as evident from the Holy Quran wherein several verses illuminate these principles. There's Surah Al-Hujurat (49:13), \"O people, We have created you from a male and a female and made you into races and tribes so that you may identify one another. Surely the noblest of you with Allah is the most righteous of you...\u201d The verse notably defines differentiation, but it does not dictate any basis for discrimination. The verses evidently underscore the ethos of harmony and human dignity central to Islam's teachings, beyond physical aspects or sexual orientations.\n\nDetractors broach the story of Lut as a condemnation of homosexuality, a misinterpretation according to scholars such as Scott Siraj al-Haqq Kugle. The scholar explains that the tale condemns lack of hospitality, hostility, and non-consensual sexual acts, rather than consensual homosexuality (Kugle, 2010).\n\nMoreover, the abiding sentiment in Islam is the celebration of Allah's creation in all its diversity (Qur'an 30:22). Muslims around the world understand and respect this teaching, and growing perspectives assert that this also considers the LGBTQ+ community's diversity within Allah's all-encompassing wisdom and creation.\n\nFurthermore, contrary to the common belief, Islamic scholarly views on homosexuality are not unanimously negative. Scholars such as Daayiee Abdullah, the openly gay Imam in the U.S, have argued that homosexuality is not inherently sinful in Islam, providing a reinterpretation of traditional Islamic texts. He suggests that we should question traditions that promote discrimination or harm, further underlining that the principles of Islam, when interpreted with an open heart, do permit homosexuality (Abdullah, 2016).\n\nIn conclusion, I uphold the contention that Islam, in its truest sense, does permit homosexuality, albeit this understanding needs evolution and an divergence from historically prejudiced interpretation. It is vital to remember that Islam, like any religion, is susceptible to human interpretation and societal biases, and is in essence, a faith that celebrates inclusivity, compassion, and equality.\n\nReferences:\n1.

      "against": "Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed fellow intellectuals, my opening argument starts with an appreciation for your attention to this delicate issue that is 'Islam permits homosexuality'. My position, based on a broad framework of Islamic teachings derived from its primary sources -- the Quran, the Hadith, and consensus of Islamic scholars -- is that Islam does not permit homosexuality. \n\nThe Quran, which Muslims believe is a divine text unaltered and unchangeable, clearly discusses this issue in its depiction of the people of Lot (or Lut, in Arabic). To paraphrase Surah Al- A'raf, 7:80-84, the Quran states, \"And [We had sent] Lot when he said to his people, \u2018Do you commit such immorality as no one has preceded you with from among the worlds? Indeed, you approach men with desire, instead of women. Rather, you are a transgressing people'...And We rained upon them a rain [of stones]. Then see how was the end of the criminals.\" (Quran 7:80-84)\n\nThese verses form the main scriptural basis of the Islamic stance toward homosexuality and clearly communicate a strong condemnation of such behavior. \n\nAdditionally, various Hadiths, sayings, actions, and approvals of Prophet Muhammad, second to the Quran in terms of the sources of Islamic law, also express explicit statements against homosexuality. A notable Hadith from Sahih Bukhari narrates that Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) said: \"Whoever you find doing the action of the people of Lot, execute the one who does it and the one to whom it is done.\" (Sahih al-Bukhari, 7:72:774)\n\nIndeed, there exists a divergence of opinions in interpreting these texts, but the consensus (ijma) of Islamic scholars throughout history, across both Sunni and Shia traditions, has predominantly been of the view that homosexuality is not permissible within the Islamic faith due to such religious texts.\n\nTherefore, the Quran, Hadith, and the consensus of scholars, which form the main sources of the Islamic jurisprudential tradition, consider homosexuality as a transgression of divine commands. This conclusion is derived not from a cultural or a temporal interpretation but from the primary, most authentic sources of Islam. That said, I hope this debate can foster understanding and respect for an issued viewed as complex within our pluralistic society today."

      "for": "Dear all,\n\nI appreciate the counter-argument presented; the interpretation of traditional sources is where the crux of this debate lies. \n\nFirst, addressing the verses from Sura Al-A'raf, I must reiterate the research of scholar Scott Siraj al-Haqq Kugle. He suggests that the wrongdoings of the Lot narrative relate to non-consensual male-to-male rape, and it was the issue of consent and respect for another's dignity, not a denunciation of homosexuality as an orientation, that was the basis of sin (Kugle, 2010). This interpretation avoids cherry-picking aspects of the narrative and respects the thematic consistency of Lot's story in context with other narratives pertaining to how we should treat fellow humans.\n\nSecond, as for the Hadith quoted, Islamic scholarship throughout history has been cautious about Hadith authenticity. Khaled Abou El Fadl, a prominent scholar of Islamic law, posited that the Hadith regarding executing homosexual individuals is weak and spurious in terms of its verifiable chain of narration. Thus, its conclusion may be deemed as flawed (El Fadl, 2013).\n\nThird, the ijma (consensus) noted from my respected opponent's argument originates from a period when understandings of sexuality were drastically different than what they are today. Culture, context, and interpretation play a significant role in religious rulings. There lies the possibility of ijma evolving, as has happened on numerous other issues in Islamic jurisprudence, such as female leadership, slavery, etc.\n\nLastly, it's crucial to mention reformist Islamic thinker Dr. Amina Wadud's perspective, which supports the Quran's ethos of justice and compassion overriding any potential inferences of homophobia. Dr. Wadud maintains that the primary message of Islam is Tawhid (the Oneness of God), and precluding any group from partaking in this divine mercy goes against the essence of Islam (Wadud, 2006).\n\nIslam's inherent acceptance of inclusivity, compassion, and human dignity sets the stage for it to incorporate modern understandings of sexual orientation within its teachings. Although the journey may be challenging, it promises to align with Islam's core principles of justice and mercy.\n\nReferences:\n1. Kugle, S.S. (2010).

      "against": "Thank you for your thoughtful points, and for the revisit to this intense debate.\n\nTo begin with, regarding Kugle's interpretation of the story of Lot, your argument suggests consent and human dignity as the main issue in the story, rather than denouncing homosexuality. Indeed, consent and human dignity are critical in all humanly relations. However, Islamic scholars like Sayyed Hossein Nasr contend that the verses in Surah Al-A'raf (7:80-84) unequivocally condemned the act of sodomy, not just rape (Nasr et al., 2015). The text's wording makes a clear statement against approaching men with desires attributed to heterosexual relationships. Sensitive reinterpretations cannot alter the text's comprehendible meaning.\n\nIn relation to the problematic Hadith validity, it is crucial to note that the debate on Hadith authenticity has occurred over centuries. Renowned Islamic scholars like Al-Shafi'i and Al-Bukhari extensively scrutinized and established standards for Hadith authentication. They acknowledged the quoted Hadith in their respective works (Brown, 2009). Given their prominent status in Islamic scholarship, their endorsement adds credibility to the Hadith and convicts homosexuality as transgressive.\n\nWith respects to evolving ijma, I see your point that consensus can change as societal constructs and understanding develop. However, Qura'nic interpretations aren't arbitrary. They connect to the original Arabic language text and the Sunnah's historical context. The principles observed in issues involving female leadership or slavery are distinct from homosexual relations. The Quran never expressly forbids female leadership, and it emphasized initiating the end of slavery peacefully and gradually. On the contrary, homosexuality, strong arguments can be made, is outright condemned (El Fadl, 2001).\n\nFinally, while Dr. Wadud's perspective is certainly well-intentioned, we should remember the fundamental principles of Tawhid don't override the practical and moral instructions for human behavior enjoined in Islam. They all exist in harmony within the faith.\n\nI concur, Islam promotes inclusivity, compassion, and human dignity. However, it also prescribes norms and limits for human behavior, just as all religions do. Ensuring human dignity does not equate to condoning all human behaviors. It is possible to respect individuals and their choices without endorsing their actions as religiously acceptable.\n\nReferences:\n1. Nasr, S. H., Dagli, C. B., Dakake, M. M., Lumbard, J. E.

    "conclusions": {
      "for": "Ladies and Gentlemen,\n\nIn conclusion, I reaffirm my proposition that Islam, when seen from an open-minded and humanistic perspective, does permit homosexuality. We must recognize that much of the anti-homosexual sentiment often attributed to Islam has been influenced by cultural and societal biases that existed when the religious texts were being interpreted. \n\nTraditional interpretations of Surah Al A'raf and the story of Lut point to the condemnation of aggressive and non-consensual behavior and not necessarily homosexuality itself, as emphasized by scholars like Scott Siraj al-Haqq Kugle. Issues within the authenticity of certain Hadiths purportedly against homosexuality, as questioned by Khaled Abou El Fadl, further put these long-held beliefs into question.\n\nIt's important to understand that ijma, or consensus, in the Islamic tradition has fluctuated over the years in respect of many subjects, reflecting the evolving understanding in various historical contexts. This notion allows room for evolving interpretations even in the modern day, thereby creating scope for incorporating non-traditional sexual orientations within the Islamic teachings.\n\nThroughout this debate, the key point that emerged robustly was Islam's commitment to compassion, inclusivity, and respect for human dignity, as conveyed in the Qur'an. Scholars and thinkers like Daayiee Abdullah and Amina Wadud upheld this ethos, emphasizing the religion's acceptance of diverse sexual orientations, and arguing against any form of discrimination or exclusion.\n\nThus, the understanding of homosexuality within the Islamic framework doesn't have to be static, rather it can evolve with increasing awareness and acceptance. We must consider that the crux of Islam lies in compassion, justice, and respect for humanity - values that ensure its accommodation of the diverse experiences of what it means to be human, including various sexual orientations. Acknowledging this is a significant step towards fostering an understanding, inclusive, and compassionate world.",
      "against": "In conclusion, this debate pivots on the interpretation of primary Islamic texts and an understanding of the flow and change in Islamic jurisprudence. Through this discourse, I have attempted to underline the clear rulings against homosexuality according to the primary sources of Islam, primarily the Quran and Hadith. I argued that the indisputable language used in Surah Al-A\u2019raf to denounce the actions of the people of Lot implies clear condemnation of homosexual acts, not solely with regards to rape as suggested by alternative interpretations. I have further iterated the authenticity of the specific Hadith invoked against homosexuality, highlighting the rigorous processes used by respected Islamic scholars in their validation.\n\nWhile acknowledging the capacity for ijma to change as understanding evolves, I've stressed that reinterpretations of the Quran should remain true to the semantic and historical context of the original texts. Quranic interpretation isn't arbitrary nor should it bend to evolving societal constructs without strong, viable backing from foundational scripts and principles. \n\nThe ethos of Tawhid, compassion, and human dignity undoubtedly underpins the teachings of Islam, but these principles do not automatically translate into religious acceptance for all behaviours. They exist harmoniously with the pragmatic moral and behavioural codes outlined in the Jurisprudential tradition of Sharia law, setting standards and boundaries for human conducts.\n\nThe essence of my argument is not an assertion of intolerance, rather an elucidation based on historical interpretations and understanding that homosexuality is considered as forbidden in Islamic teachings. Despite these traditional interpretations, it's also imperative to foster respectful dialogues and inclusion for all individuals, regardless of their choices, within our diverse and pluralistic societies."
