      "for": "Esteemed judges, fellow debaters, and audience members,\n\nWe stand today to discuss a nuanced and often misunderstood aspect of Islamic finance: the permissibility of mortgages with interest. While it is true that traditional Islamic jurisprudence prohibits riba, or usury, which involves charging exorbitant interest rates, this prohibition does not extend to all forms of financial transactions involving interest. \n\nFirstly, it is crucial to understand the distinction between **riba** and **fair profit**. In Islam, earning a fair profit from legitimate business activities is encouraged. This principle extends to real estate transactions.  The Islamic legal scholars (fuqaha) have permitted the practice of **Murabaha**, which involves a seller marking up the price of a property and selling it to a buyer at that higher price, effectively acting as a loan with a pre-determined profit margin agreed upon by both parties.\n\nFurthermore, modern Islamic finance has developed innovative financial instruments like **Islamic mortgages (Ijarah)**.  These contracts involve renting the property for a set period, eventually leading to ownership after the rental payments are completed. This structure avoids charging interest directly and instead operates as a lease agreement with predetermined rent payments that ultimately cover the cost of the property.\n\nThe respected Islamic scholar **Sheikh Yusuf al-Qaradawi**, in his book \"**The Lawful and the Prohibited in Islam**,\" states: \u201cIt is permissible to buy a house by means of a loan, provided that it does not involve riba.\u201d  This statement clearly indicates that obtaining a mortgage for a house is permissible under Islamic law as long as the terms do not violate the prohibition against riba.\n\nTherefore, the proposition stands firm: Islam permits Muslims to take mortgages with interest under certain conditions and through legal mechanisms designed to comply with Islamic principles.",
      "against": "## Opening Argument: Islam Prohibits Interest-Based Mortgages\n\nEsteemed judges, fellow debaters, and audience members, I stand before you today to unequivocally state that Islam prohibits Muslims from taking mortgages with interest. This is not a matter of personal opinion or interpretation; it is a fundamental principle enshrined in the Quran and Sunnah, the two pillars of Islamic jurisprudence. \n\nThe prohibition against interest, known as \"riba\" in Arabic, is explicitly stated throughout the Quran:\n\n**Quran 2:275:** \"Allah permits trade and forbids riba.\"\n\n**Quran 30:39:**  \"Those who consume Riba will not stand (on the Day of Judgement) except like the one whom Satan has touched and driven to madness. That is because they say that what Allah has forbidden is permissible.\"\n\nThese verses leave no room for ambiguity. Islam clearly defines interest as a harmful practice that undermines justice and fosters exploitation. \n\nFurthermore, the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) condemned riba in numerous hadiths:\n\n**Narrated by Bukhari:** \"The Prophet cursed those who consume Riba, those who pay it, the witnesses to it and the scribes.\"\n\n**Narrated by Muslim:** \"The Prophet said: 'Whoever eats a thing of interest will not be free from Allah's punishment until he gives back all that he has taken with interest.'\" \n\nThese pronouncements demonstrate the severity with which Islam views interest. Taking out a mortgage with an interest component directly violates these teachings, thus making it impermissible in Islamic law.\n\nWhile some argue for permissible alternatives like profit-sharing agreements (\"Musharakah\"), they often fail to capture the complexities and risks inherent in such arrangements. True adherence to Islamic finance necessitates finding ethical and lawful ways to meet financial needs without resorting to interest-based transactions.\n\n\nThank you."

    "round_1": {
      "for": "The opposing team makes some valid points about the Quranic verses and hadiths that clearly condemn riba.  However, they fail to recognize the nuanced application of Islamic law and the distinction between traditional usury and permissible financial instruments. \n\nLet's address their main arguments point by point:\n\n**1.  Quranic Verses:** While the Quran unequivocally prohibits riba in its general sense, it is crucial to understand the context. The verses they cited primarily target exploitative practices where exorbitant interest rates are imposed with little regard for fairness or necessity.  The focus is on preventing predatory lending and economic exploitation, not on prohibiting all forms of financing involving a profit element.\n\n**2.  Prophet Muhammad's Condemnation:** \nSimilarly, the Prophet\u2019s condemnation of riba pertains to unjust practices that harm the less fortunate. It is important to note that the Prophet himself engaged in financial transactions involving calculated profit margins. For example, he participated in trade and agricultural ventures, earning a legitimate return on his investment (see Ibn Sa'd, *Kitab al-Tabaqat al-Kabir*, Vol. 1).\n\n**3.  Permissible Alternatives:** The opposing team dismisses the concept of alternatives like Musharakah without fully exploring their benefits. While complex and requiring careful structuring, these instruments allow for shared ownership and profit distribution based on agreed-upon contributions, avoiding the direct payment of interest that is deemed haram. \n\n**4. Islamic Legal Scholar Consensus:**  The statement by Sheikh Yusuf al-Qaradawi mentioned in my opening argument highlights the consensus among many prominent Islamic scholars. They agree that obtaining a mortgage through ethical means like Murabaha or Ijarah, which involve pre-determined profit margins and rental agreements respectively, is permissible under Islamic law.\n\n**Conclusion:** \nThe core of Islam is promoting justice, fairness, and prosperity for all.  While the prohibition against riba is crucial, it should not be misconstrued as a blanket ban on all financial transactions involving interest. By understanding the nuanced interpretations within Islamic jurisprudence, utilizing ethical financial instruments like Murabaha and Ijarah, and seeking guidance from qualified scholars, Muslims can navigate the complexities of mortgages while adhering to the principles of their faith.",
      "against": "The opposing team attempts to soften the clear message of Islamic prohibition on interest by focusing on context and nuanced interpretations. While acknowledging the Quranic verses condemning riba, they argue that these primarily target exploitative practices rather than all forms of financing involving profit. This line of reasoning is flawed for several reasons:\n\n**1. Ambiguity in Defining \"Exploitation\":** The term \u201cexploitation\u201d is subjective and open to interpretation.  Who defines what constitutes an \"exorbitant\" interest rate or an unfair practice?  Leaving this definition ambiguous allows for the creeping acceptance of riba under the guise of permissible financial instruments. Islamic law aims for clear guidelines, not subjective interpretations that can lead to moral ambiguity.\n\n**2. The Prophet's Actions vs. Islamic Principles:** While it is true that the Prophet engaged in trade and agricultural ventures earning a profit, these activities were governed by specific principles of fairness, transparency, and ethical conduct.  The Quran explicitly forbids engaging in transactions \"which are doubtful.\" (Quran 4:29). Profit-making through interest inherently violates this principle as it involves gaining wealth without contributing any real value or service.\n\n**3. Distorting the Purpose of Islamic Finance:** The argument that permissible alternatives like Musharakah completely negate the issue of riba misses the point.  The purpose of Islamic finance is to establish a system based on justice, equity, and shared responsibility, free from exploitation inherent in interest-based systems. While alternatives exist, they often involve complexities and risks that can be challenging to navigate for average individuals, ultimately compromising the core principles of ethical financial conduct.\n\n**4. Consensus Among Scholars:**  The claim that many Islamic scholars permit mortgages through Murabaha or Ijarah is misleading. There is a significant difference between interpretations within Islamic jurisprudence. While some scholars may allow these instruments under specific conditions, they often require strict adherence to guidelines and face scrutiny due to the inherent potential for ambiguity regarding interest-like features. \n\n**Conclusion:** \nThe Quran's clear prohibition on riba remains unwavering.  Attempts to justify interest-based mortgages through nuanced interpretations or permissible alternatives ultimately undermine the fundamental principles of Islamic finance. True adherence to Islam necessitates seeking ethical and lawful ways to meet financial needs without resorting to interest, which inherently undermines justice and fairness."

    "conclusions": {
      "for": "Esteemed judges and audience, the debate has highlighted the crucial distinction between traditional usury and permissible financial instruments within Islamic finance. While the Quran and Sunnah unequivocally condemn exploitative interest rates that prey on the vulnerable, they do not prohibit all forms of financial transactions involving a profit element.  \n\nWe have presented clear evidence demonstrating that Islamic jurisprudence allows for mortgages under specific conditions:\n\n* **Murabaha:** A system where a seller marks up the property price, effectively acting as a loan with a pre-determined profit margin agreed upon by both parties.\n* **Ijarah:**  A rental agreement where the buyer gradually acquires ownership of the property through predetermined rent payments that ultimately cover its cost.\n\nFurthermore, prominent Islamic scholars like Sheikh Yusuf al-Qaradawi have explicitly stated that obtaining a mortgage is permissible under Islamic law as long as the terms adhere to these principles. \n\nThe proposition stands firm: Islam permits Muslims to take mortgages with interest under certain conditions and through legal mechanisms designed to comply with Islamic principles. This allows individuals to fulfill their housing needs while upholding the core values of fairness, justice, and ethical financial practices enshrined within the faith. Thank you.",
      "against": "Esteemed judges, fellow debaters, and audience members, we stand firm in our conviction that Islam unequivocally prohibits Muslims from taking mortgages with interest. The Quran and Sunnah leave no room for ambiguity: riba, or interest, is condemned as a harmful practice that fosters exploitation and undermines justice. \n\nWhile the opposing team attempts to soften this message through nuanced interpretations and permissible alternatives, their arguments ultimately fall short. Defining \"exploitation\" subjectively opens the door to moral ambiguity, while emphasizing the Prophet's own financial dealings ignores the specific principles of fairness and ethical conduct that governed his transactions.  \n\nMoreover, claiming consensus among scholars on interest-based mortgages is misleading, as diverse interpretations exist within Islamic jurisprudence. True adherence to Islam necessitates seeking ethical and lawful ways to meet financial needs without resorting to riba. Let us not compromise our faith by accepting practices that directly violate its core principles. We urge you to recognize the undeniable truth: **Islam prohibits interest-based mortgages.**  \n\n\nThank you."
