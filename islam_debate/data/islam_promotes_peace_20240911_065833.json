      "for": "Assalamu Alaikum (Peace be upon you). As a proponent of the proposition that Islam promotes peace, I would like to present the following opening argument, supported by relevant citations from the Quran and the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him).\n\nIslam, at its core, is a religion that advocates for peace, harmony, and compassion towards all of humanity. The very word 'Islam' is derived from the Arabic root word 'Salaam,' which means 'peace.' The Quran, the holy book of Muslims, repeatedly emphasizes the importance of pursuing peace and rejecting violence and oppression. In Surah Al-Nisa, verse 90, Allah states: \"If they incline to peace, then incline to it and trust in Allah.\" (Quran 4:90)\n\nMoreover, the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) consistently preached and exemplified the principles of peace, tolerance, and non-violence throughout his life. In his last sermon, he famously said, \"All mankind is from Adam and Eve, an Arab has no superiority over a non-Arab, nor a non-Arab has any superiority over an Arab; also, a white has no superiority over a black, nor a black has any superiority over a white \u2013 except by piety and good action.\" (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Book of Revelation, Hadith no. 23)\n\nIslam promotes peace not only among Muslims but also extends its teachings to foster peaceful coexistence with people of other faiths. The Quran explicitly states: \"Allah does not forbid you from those who do not fight you because of religion and do not expel you from your homes \u2013 from being righteous toward them and acting justly toward them. Indeed, Allah loves those who act justly.\" (Quran 60:8)\n\nFurthermore, the principles of justice, mercy, and compassion are deeply ingrained in Islamic teachings, which serve as a foundation for promoting peace and harmony in society. The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said, \"Whosoever shows mercy, even to an animal, shall be rewarded.\" (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Book of Manners, Hadith no. 6012)\n\nIn conclusion, the fundamental teachings of Islam, as outlined in the Quran and exemplified by the life of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), consistently promote the values of peace, tolerance, and compassion towards all of humanity. Islam rejects violence, oppression, and injustice, and instead encourages its followers to pursue peaceful means of resolving conflicts and fostering harmonious relationships with people of all faiths and backgrounds.",
      "against": "Here is a potential opening argument against the proposition that Islam promotes peace, with relevant citations:\n\n\"While Islam means 'peace' and certainly has peaceful elements within its teachings, there is also substantial evidence that aspects of Islamic doctrine and historical practices have promoted violence, intolerance, and conflict. \n\nThe concept of jihad, while having an inward spiritual meaning, has also been used to justify offensive military conquests and forced conversions throughout history, from the early Muslim conquests out of Arabia to modern extremist groups. The Quran contains verses sanctioning violence against unbelievers (9:5, 9:29, 47:4).\n\nThere are harsh punishments endorsed in Islamic law such as execution for apostates and amputation for thieves. The subordinate status of women and non-Muslims is codified in Islamic teachings (4:34, 9:29). Hardline interpretations provide the ideological basis for groups like ISIS and Al-Qaeda to commit atrocities in the name of Islam.\n\nWhile not all Muslims follow such interpretations, denial of these elements within Islamic scripture and tradition ignores an important driving force behind much historical and modern conflict and human rights abuses carried out in the name of Islam.  A nuanced and honest evaluation must acknowledge these problematic aspects that contradict the idea of Islam as wholly and uniquely a religion of peace.\"\n\nReferences:\n\"The Legacy of Jihad\" by Andrew Bostom (Academic treatment of doctrine and history of conquests)\nhttps://quranx.com/ (Quranic verses cited)"

      "for": "Thank you for raising those important points. I acknowledge that there have been instances throughout history where certain Islamic teachings have been misinterpreted and misused to justify violence and oppression. However, I respectfully disagree that this represents the true essence and spirit of Islam, which is fundamentally rooted in the promotion of peace, justice, and compassion.\n\nFirstly, regarding the concept of jihad, it is true that the term has been distorted and exploited by extremist groups to justify acts of terrorism and violence. However, the predominant understanding of jihad among mainstream Islamic scholars and the vast majority of Muslims worldwide is that of an inward spiritual struggle against one's own ego and negative impulses. The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) himself stated, \"We have returned from the lesser jihad to the greater jihad,\" referring to the inner struggle as the more profound and continuous jihad (Sahih Al-Bayhaqi).\n\nFurthermore, the verses cited from the Quran regarding fighting and violence must be understood in their proper historical context. These verses were revealed during times of active warfare and aggression against the early Muslim community, and they served as a means of self-defense and preservation. The Quran explicitly states, \"Fight in the way of Allah those who fight you but do not transgress. Indeed, Allah does not like transgressors.\" (2:190) This verse clearly establishes that violence is only permitted in self-defense and not as a means of aggression or oppression.\n\nRegarding the punishments prescribed in Islamic law, it is important to note that they are subject to stringent conditions and safeguards, and their primary purpose is to serve as a deterrent and maintain social order. Additionally, the Quran emphasizes the principles of mercy, forgiveness, and compassion, stating, \"The recompense for an injury is an injury equal thereto (in degree); but if a person forgives and makes reconciliation, his reward is due from Allah.\" (42:40)\n\nAs for the status of women and non-Muslims, the Quran and the Prophet's teachings uphold principles of equality, justice, and respect for all human beings, regardless of gender or faith. The Quran states, \"O mankind, indeed We have created you from male and female and made you peoples and tribes that you may know one another. Indeed, the most noble of you in the sight of Allah is the most righteous of you.\" (49:13) Similarly, the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said, \"Whoever oppresses a dhimmi (non-Muslim living under Muslim rule) or violates his rights, I will be his prosecutor on the Day of Judgment.\" (Al-Muwatta, Book of Judgments)\n\nIt is true that there have been instances throughout history where these teachings have been distorted or ignored, leading to oppression and injustice. However, these actions are in direct contradiction to the core principles of Islam, which emphasize peace, justice, and compassion for all humanity.\n\nIn conclusion, while there have been regrettable instances of misinterpretation and misuse of Islamic teachings, the fundamental spirit and essence of Islam, as embodied in the Quran and the life of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), consistently promote peace, tolerance, and respect for all human beings. It is our collective responsibility as Muslims to uphold these noble principles and reject any attempts to distort the true message of Islam for violent or oppressive purposes.",
      "against": "I appreciate you acknowledging the concerning aspects I raised, but I respectfully disagree with your characterization that these represent distortions or misinterpretations of the true spirit of Islam. The evidence indicates they are deeply rooted in Islamic scripture and tradition itself.\n\nOn jihad, while spiritual jihad is one dimension, there is an unmistakable doctrine and historical precedent for armed jihad and offensive military conquest in the name of Islam. The Quran promises divine rewards for those who \"slay and are slain\" for Allah (9:111). The early Muslim conquests into the Christian Byzantine and Sassanian Persian empires were explicitly offensive military campaigns, not just self-defense.\n\nThe context of the \"sword verses\" (9:5, 9:29, etc.) that you cite involved sanctioning violence against polytheists and subjugation of Jews/Christians as dhimmis after the conquest of Arab pagan tribes. Ibn Kathir, a renowned Quranic commentator, states these verses are for \"waging war against the idolaters and encouraging the Faithful to fight against them.\"\n\nOn punishments, the hudud punishments you minimize like execution for apostasy and amputation are derived directly from the Quran, hadiths, and scholarly consensus. Apostasy was a capital offense according to the Hanafi, Maliki, Shafi'i, and Hanbali Sunni schools (Al-Mawardi, Al-Ahkam). Amnesty International has documented ongoing apostasy executions in over 15 Muslim-majority nations.\n\nRegarding women's status, while the Quran has some positive statements, verses like 4:34 sanction male authority over women and permit wife-beating in cases of \"disobedience.\" Major Islamic schools codified highly unequal rules for women, from testimony being worth half a man's, to severe restrictions on divorce, inheritance, dress, etc. Global injustices like honor killings and child marriage stem from such medieval norms.\n\nI agree the spirit of Islam has positive elements. But an honest analysis must confront its very real history of intolerance, violence, and oppressive practices directly rooted in core Islamic texts and jurisprudence - not dismiss them as distortions. This goes well beyond historical \"instances\" and remains an ongoing human rights crisis. Denial only empowers extremist interpretations to persist."

    "conclusions": {
      "for": "Here is a concluding statement summarizing the key points made in favor of the proposition that Islam promotes peace:\n\nIn this debate, we have examined the core teachings of Islam as outlined in the Quran and the life of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). Despite attempts by some to misinterpret and exploit certain aspects of Islamic doctrine to justify violence and oppression, the fundamental essence of Islam is rooted in the promotion of peace, justice, and compassion towards all of humanity.  \n\nThe very meaning of the word \"Islam\" is derived from the root word meaning \"peace,\" and the Quran repeatedly emphasizes the importance of pursuing peaceful resolutions to conflicts. The concept of jihad has been distorted by extremist groups, whereas its true meaning as understood by mainstream Islamic scholars refers primarily to an inward spiritual struggle against one's own negative impulses.\n\nWhile verses related to warfare were revealed in the historical context of aggression against the early Muslim community, the Quran clearly establishes that violence is only permissible for self-defense and not as a means of oppression or transgression. Moreover, Islamic law's punishments are subject to stringent conditions and are primarily meant as deterrents to maintain social order.  \n\nUltimately, the Quran and the Prophet's teachings uphold equality, justice, and respect for all human beings, regardless of gender or faith. Instances of oppression and injustice throughout history are in direct contradiction to these noble principles that form the bedrock of the Islamic faith.\n\nIt is our responsibility as Muslims to uphold the true spirit of Islam, which consistently promotes peace, tolerance, and compassion. While no religion is immune to misinterpretation or exploitation, the core message of Islam remains one of peace and harmonious coexistence for all of humanity.",
      "against": "Here is a potential concluding statement against the proposition that Islam promotes peace:\n\nIn conclusion, while Islam certaintly contains teachings that emphasize peace, compassion, and spiritual development, there is overwhelming textual and historical evidence that core elements of Islamic doctrine and tradition have directly promoted violence, intolerance, and human rights abuses. \n\nThe concept of offensive military jihad and forced conversions were central to the rise and expansion of Islam through conquest of vast territories. Verses in the Quran explicitly sanction violence against non-Muslims and subjugation of religious minorities. Islamic jurisprudence codified harsh punishments like execution for apostasy and cruel corporal punishments derived directly from scripture.\n\nThe subordinate status of women is theologically grounded in the Quran and was institutionalized through highly discriminatory laws and norms across the medieval Islamic world. A long legacy of human rights violations against women, from honor killings to child marriage, can be traced back to these religious foundations.  \n\nWhile not all Muslims follow such interpretations today, these problematic aspects represent central tenets, not fringe distortions, of Islamic scripture, tradition and legal systems. Denying or minimizing this intrinsic ideological basis for violence and oppression does a disservice to the ongoing battles for reform and human rights across the Muslim world.\n\nAn honest evaluation must confront how Islamic doctrine has fueled acts of aggression, religious persecution, institutionalized discrimination and human rights abuses on a mass scale throughout history down to the present day. To claim Islam uniquely and wholly promotes peace ignores this well-established pattern and the need for substantive theological reforms to make it compatible with modern human rights standards."
