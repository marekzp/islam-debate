      "for": "Ladies and Gentlemen, distinguished panelists, and esteemed audience,\n\nI stand before you today to argue the affirmative side of our motion: \"Muslims can be active citizens in secular countries.\" This statement is not merely a declaration of fact but an assertion of the inherent compatibility between Islam and democracy, and Muslims with secular governance. Let me present three compelling reasons why I believe this proposition is true.\n\n1. **Islam and Democracy Share Common Values**\n\nDemocracy, at its core, embodies values such as freedom, equality, justice, and human dignity - values that are also central to Islamic teachings. The Quran states, \"O you who have believed, be persistently standing firm in justice\" (5:8), and Prophet Muhammad emphasized, \"None of you truly believes until he wants for his brother what he wants for himself.\" (Sahih Al-Bukhari)\n\nThe Muslim world is not a monolith; Muslims live as active citizens across various secular democracies like France, Germany, the United States, and Indonesia. They contribute to their societies economically, socially, and politically, proving that Muslims can indeed thrive in secular countries.\n\n2. **Muslims Have Successfully Participated in Secular Politics**\n\nHistory is replete with examples of Muslim individuals who have risen through the ranks of political systems to become active citizens and leaders in secular nations:\n\n- Pakistan's first Prime Minister, Liaquat Ali Khan, played a pivotal role in drafting his country's constitution.\n- Tunisia's Beji Ca\u00efd Essebsi became the first democratically elected president of his country after the Arab Spring, advocating for a secular, democratic Tunisia.\n- In the United States, Kevina Merrell became the first Muslim woman to serve as a state legislator in Missouri.\n\nThese examples demonstrate that Muslims are not only capable but also committed to participating in and contributing to secular political systems.\n\n3. **Secularism Ensures Religious Freedom**\n\nSecularism ensures the separation of religion from state affairs, thereby guaranteeing freedom of religion for all citizens. This inclusivity allows Muslims to practice their faith without coercion or fear of persecution. For instance, Article 18 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) guarantees the right to freedom of thought, conscience, and religion - a principle upheld by secular countries.\n\nMoreover, the European Court of Human Rights has repeatedly emphasized that secularism is compatible with religious freedom, most notably in its landmark case, Laparade v. France (2008).\n\nIn conclusion, Muslims can be active citizens in secular countries because Islam and democracy share common values, Muslims have successfully participated in secular politics, and secularism ensures religious freedom. I look forward to a robust debate on these points.\n\nThank you.\n\n*Citations:*\n- Quran: https://quran.com/5/8\n- Sahih Al-Bukhari: http://sunnah.com/bukhari/1/43\n- Universal Declaration of Human Rights: http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/\n- European Court of Human Rights - Laparade v.

      "against": "Ladies and Gentlemen,\n\nI stand before you today to argue against the proposition that \"Muslims can be active citizens in secular countries.\" While I do not deny that Muslims can, in theory, participate in secular societies, my contention is that there are significant practical obstacles and inherent tensions that make this proposition challenging to uphold consistently. Let me present three compelling reasons why:\n\n1. **Incompatibility of Sharia Law with Secularism:**\n   - The primary issue lies in the compatibility of Sharia law, which many Muslims strive to adhere to, with secular legal systems. Sharia is a comprehensive system that encompasses not just religious rituals but also criminal law, family law, and governance principles. This often clashes with secular laws, particularly on matters such as inheritance rights (Qur'an 4:11-12), punishments for apostasy or blasphemy (e.g., in Saudi Arabia and Pakistan), and the status of women (e.g., in divorce proceedings).\n   - *Citation:* Joseph Schacht, \"An Introduction to Islamic Law,\" Oxford University Press (1964)\n\n2. **The Debate over Political Islam:**\n   - The idea that Muslims can actively participate in secular politics without seeking to implement Sharia law remains a contentious one. Many Muslim groups and individuals argue that Islam is inherently political and cannot be separated from governance. This view often leads to tension when they attempt to engage with secular political systems.\n   - *Citation:* John L. Esposito, \"The Future of Islam,\" Oxford University Press (2011)\n\n3. **Discrimination and Trust Deficit:**\n   - Even if Muslims theoretically can be active citizens in secular countries, practical hurdles such as discrimination, Islamophobia, and a trust deficit between Muslim minorities and the broader society pose significant challenges.\n   - *Citation:* Pew Research Center, \"The Future of the Global Muslim Population,\" June 2015\n\nIn conclusion, while it's technically possible for Muslims to be active citizens in secular countries, there are profound practical, legal, and societal obstacles that make this proposition questionable. Until these challenges are addressed openly and honestly, the idea that Muslims can seamlessly integrate into secular systems remains largely aspirational rather than realistic.\n\nThank you."

      "for": "Ladies and Gentlemen,\n\nI appreciate my opponent's acknowledgment of the theoretical possibility of Muslims being active citizens in secular countries while also presenting challenges they face. However, I maintain that these obstacles are neither insurmountable nor unique to Muslims. Moreover, the examples and statistics demonstrate a growing trend of Muslim integration into secular societies. Here's how we can address my opponent's arguments:\n\n1. **Incompatibility of Sharia Law with Secularism:**\n\n   While it's true that some aspects of Sharia law may clash with secular laws, this is not an issue unique to Islam or Muslims. All religions have principles that might conflict with secular laws. The key lies in how one approaches these differences:\n\n   - **Dual Loyalty:** Many Muslims practice their faith while also adhering to the laws of their countries. For instance, Muslims in Europe and North America actively participate in politics, respecting both secular laws and Islamic principles (Hasan, 2016).\n   - **Interpretation and Adaptation:** Sharia law has evolved over centuries through interpretation by scholars, jurists, and legal experts. Muslims living in secular societies can adapt their understanding of Sharia to align with the broader societal norms and laws, much like how other religious groups have done throughout history.\n   - *Citation:* Asma U. Barlas, \"Believing Women\" in Islam: Unreading Patriarchal Interpretations of the Qur'an,\" University of Texas Press (2002)\n\n2. **The Debate over Political Islam:**\n\n   The idea that Islam is inherently political has led some Muslims to seek political power to implement their vision of an Islamic state. However, this is not a universal sentiment among Muslims:\n\n   - **Cultural Muslim Democrats:** A significant portion of Muslims in secular societies support democracy and secular governance without seeking to establish an Islamic state (Pew Research Center, 2013).\n   - **Muslims for Secularism:** Many Muslims actively advocate for a separation between religion and politics. For example, the Turkish political party AKP, while having roots in political Islam, has consistently supported secular democratic principles.\n   - *Citation:* Pew Research Center, \"The World's Muslims: Unity in Diversity,\" August 2013\n\n3. **Discrimination and Trust Deficit:**\n\n   Discrimination against Muslim minorities is indeed a challenge, but it's not an insurmountable barrier to their participation as active citizens:\n\n   - **Muslims in Political Office:** Despite facing discrimination, Muslims have successfully entered politics in secular countries. For instance, in the UK, 16 Muslim MPs were elected to Parliament in 2019 (Muslim Council of Britain, 2019).\n   - **Economic Integration:** Muslims are increasingly contributing to the economies of secular countries they reside in. In the US, Muslims contribute around $170 billion annually through consumer spending alone (Dildar & Smith, 2015).\n   - *Citation:* Muslim Council of Britain, \"Muslims in the UK: Key Facts and Statistics,\" December 2019\n\nIn conclusion, while my opponent has raised valid concerns, they are not unique to Muslims or insurmountable barriers. Muslims have proven their ability to actively participate as citizens in secular countries, adapting their understanding of Sharia law, supporting democratic principles, and contributing economically despite facing discrimination. It's crucial to address these challenges openly but also acknowledge the progress made so far.\n\nThank you.\n\n*Citations:*\n- Zainah Anwar & Edward E.

      "against": "Ladies and Gentlemen,\n\nI appreciate my opponent's effort to address the challenges I've raised, but their responses often oversimplify complex issues and gloss over fundamental tensions between Islam and secularism. Here's how we can reassess their arguments:\n\n1. **Incompatibility of Sharia Law with Secularism:**\n\n   While it's true that other religions might have principles conflicting with secular laws, the issue is far more profound in the case of Islam due to its comprehensive nature. My opponent cited Barlas' work, but Barlas herself acknowledges the patriarchal aspects of Islamic law and argues for a reinterpretation, which is precisely the challenge at hand:\n\n   - **Dual Loyalty:** Many Muslims struggle with the notion of dual loyalty when Sharia principles directly contradict secular laws. For instance, in Germany, Muslim immigrants have faced moral dilemmas regarding family law matters, such as inheritance rights (Bader & Hamdy, 2010).\n   - **Interpretation and Adaptation:** The adaptation of Sharia to align with secular laws is a contentious issue. Progressive interpretations risk being seen as unIslamic by conservatives, while strict adherence can lead to legal complications. For example, in Canada, the niqab ban faced criticism from both those who saw it as discriminatory against Muslims and those who believed it infringed on women's rights under Sharia law (Canadian Islamic Congress, 2011).\n   - *Citation:* Bader & Hamdy, \"Muslim Integration in Germany: Challenges and Opportunities,\" German Institute for International and Security Affairs (SWP), March 2010\n\n2. **The Debate over Political Islam:**\n\n   My opponent acknowledges the debate but underplays its significance and impact on Muslim politics:\n\n   - **Cultural Muslim Democrats:** While it's true that many Muslims support democracy, this support often comes with caveats tied to their interpretation of Islamic principles. For instance, in Indonesia, some Muslims express ambivalence towards secularism, seeing it as a Western concept incompatible with Islam (Dhofier, 2009).\n   - **Muslims for Secularism:** The AKP's shift away from political Islam has been gradual and fraught with internal divisions. Moreover, other Muslim-majority countries like Malaysia have seen political Islamists gain power despite secular systems.\n   - *Citation:* Dhofier, \"Islamic Movements in Indonesia,\" Institute of Southeast Asian Studies (ISEAS), June 2009\n\n3. **Discrimination and Trust Deficit:**\n\n   My opponent cherry-picks examples to downplay discrimination against Muslims while ignoring the systemic issues at play:\n\n   - **Muslims in Political Office:** Despite the election of Muslim MPs, Islamophobia remains rampant among British political circles. For instance, a 2019 survey found that 56% of Britons would be uncomfortable with a Muslim Prime Minister (Ipsos MORI, 2019).\n   - **Economic Integration:** While Muslims contribute significantly to economies, they often face barriers to upward mobility due to discrimination. In the US, Muslim Americans have lower median household incomes and higher poverty rates than the general population (Pew Research Center, 2017).\n\nIn conclusion, my opponent has failed to address the fundamental tensions between Islam and secularism adequately. The challenges I've raised remain unresolved:\n\n- Sharia law's comprehensive nature makes it difficult for Muslims to reconcile with secular laws.\n- The debate around political Islam impacts Muslim politics globally.\n- Systemic discrimination against Muslims persists despite individual successes.\n\n*Citations:*\n- Canadian Islamic Congress, \"The Niqab Debate: A Statement by the Canadian Islamic Congress,\" October 2011\n- Ipsos MORI, \"Perceptions of Islam and Muslims in Britain,\" February 2019\n- Pew Research Center, \"Muslim Americans: No Signs of Growth in Alienation or Support for ISIS,\" July 2017\n\nThank you."

      "for": "Ladies and Gentlemen,\n\nIn conclusion, I maintain that Muslims can indeed be active citizens in secular countries, despite the challenges we've discussed today. Let me summarize my position and the key points I've made:\n\n1. **Muslims are actively participating as citizens in secular societies:** Throughout this debate, we've seen numerous examples of Muslims serving in political office, contributing to economies, and supporting democratic principles. From the 16 Muslim MPs elected to the UK Parliament in 2019 to the estimated $170 billion annual consumer spending by American Muslims, these statistics illustrate a clear trend of Muslim integration and engagement in secular societies.\n\n2. **Sharia law's compatibility with secular laws is not unique to Islam:** All religions have principles that might conflict with secular laws. The solution lies not in avoiding these differences but in fostering dialogue, understanding, and mutual adaptation. Many Muslims worldwide demonstrate this through their practice of dual loyalty - adhering to both secular laws and Islamic principles.\n\n3. **The debate over political Islam is not representative of all Muslims:** While some Muslims might advocate for implementing Sharia law or establishing an Islamic state, many more support democracy and secular governance without seeking religious-political integration. The example of the AKP party in Turkey, which has consistently supported secular democratic principles, underscores this point.\n\n4. **Challenges faced by Muslim minorities are not insurmountable barriers:** Discrimination and trust deficits may pose obstacles to Muslims' full participation as active citizens. However, these challenges can be addressed openly through sincere dialogue, policy reforms, education, and community engagement. We must remember that progress often comes gradually and requires collective effort.\n\nIn closing, I'd like to emphasize that the question of whether Muslims can be active citizens in secular countries is not one with a simple yes or no answer. It's complex, nuanced, and ever-evolving. But what is clear from our discussion today is that Muslims are indeed actively participating as citizens in secular societies worldwide, adapting their understanding of Sharia law, supporting democratic principles, and contributing economically despite facing challenges.\n\nWe must continue to foster dialogue, address concerns openly, and work together to create more inclusive and equitable societies where every citizen - regardless of faith or background - can thrive. Thank you for the opportunity to discuss these important issues today.",
      "against": "**Concluding Statement:**\n\nLadies and gentlemen,\n\nThroughout this discourse, I have attempted to paint a nuanced picture of Muslims in secular countries, acknowledging both their progress and the challenges they face. Here's a summary of my stance and key points:\n\n1. **Muslims adapt Sharia law principles within secular frameworks:**\n   - Many Muslims strive to reconcile Sharia law with secular laws, often leading to innovative interpretations and adaptations.\n   - Examples include the \"Muslim Democrats\" in Turkey, who have successfully navigated secular politics while maintaining their Islamic identity.\n\n2. **The debate around political Islam is complex and impactful:**\n   - While some Muslims actively support democratic principles, others remain ambivalent or express reservations due to their interpretation of Islamic principles.\n   - This debate influences Muslim politics globally, with some movements advocating for political Islam, while others advocate for secularism.\n\n3. **Discrimination against Muslims persists despite economic contributions:**\n   - Muslims contribute significantly to the economies of secular countries but often face barriers to upward mobility and discrimination.\n   - Systemic issues such as Islamophobia, exemplified by attitudes towards Muslim politicians in Britain, highlight the persistent trust deficit between Muslims and non-Muslims.\n\nIn conclusion, it's crucial to address these challenges openly while acknowledging the progress made thus far. We must engage with Muslims on their terms, respecting their interpretations of Islamic principles while advocating for secular values such as gender equality, freedom of speech, and democracy. By fostering inclusive dialogue and promoting mutual understanding, we can bridge divides and work together towards a more harmonious and equitable society.\n\nThank you."
