        "While Islam, like many religions, contains teachings about peace, there are aspects of Islamic doctrine and history that make it difficult to claim that Islam as a whole promotes peace. The Quran and Hadith contain numerous passages calling for violence against non-believers and apostates. For example, Quran 9:5 states 'fight and slay the pagans wherever ye find them.' Islamic law (Sharia) prescribes harsh punishments including death for apostasy and blasphemy. Throughout history, Islamic empires expanded largely through military conquest. Today, Islamist extremist groups continue to cite religious justification for violence. While many Muslims are peaceful, these problematic elements within Islam's core texts and historical practice make it challenging to argue that Islam inherently promotes peace.",

The Quran includes verses like 'kill them wherever you find them' (2:191) and 'fight those who do not believe in Allah' (9:29). While many Muslims interpret these passages metaphorically or as specific to historical contexts, they have been used to justify violence by extremist groups.  Some scholars argue that Islam's concept of jihad, which can mean both spiritual struggle and physical warfare, has contributed to religiously-motivated violence throughout history. The spread of Islam through military conquest in its early centuries set a precedent that some use to justify aggression today.  Additionally, some Islamic legal schools prescribe harsh punishments for apostasy and blasphemy, which can promote intolerance and violence towards religious minorities and dissenters in some Muslim-majority countries.  It's important to note that the vast majority of Muslims are peaceful and reject violence. However, the existence of scriptural passages and historical precedents that can be used to justify aggression remains a challenge within Islam that deserves critical examination."

        "Islam's sacred texts contain numerous passages that can be interpreted as promoting violence against non-believers. The Quran includes verses like 'kill them wherever you find them' (2:191) and 'fight those who do not believe in Allah' (9:29). While many Muslims interpret these passages metaphorically or as specific to historical contexts, they have been used to justify violence by extremist groups.  Some scholars argue that Islam's concept of jihad, which can mean both spiritual struggle and physical warfare, has contributed to religiously-motivated violence throughout history. The spread of Islam through military conquest in its early centuries set a precedent that some use to justify aggression today.  Additionally, some Islamic legal schools prescribe harsh punishments for apostasy and blasphemy, which can promote intolerance and violence towards religious minorities and dissenters in some Muslim-majority countries.  It's important to note that the vast majority of Muslims are peaceful and reject violence. However, the existence of scriptural passages and historical precedents that can be used to justify aggression remains a challenge within Islam that deserves critical examination."

            "While Islam means 'peace' and certainly has peaceful elements within its teachings, there is also substantial evidence that aspects of Islamic doctrine and historical practices have promoted violence, intolerance, and conflict.   The concept of jihad, while having an inward spiritual meaning, has also been used to justify offensive military conquests and forced conversions throughout history, from the early Muslim conquests out of Arabia to modern extremist groups. The Quran contains verses sanctioning violence against unbelievers (9:5, 9:29, 47:4).  There are harsh punishments endorsed in Islamic law such as execution for apostates and amputation for thieves. The subordinate status of women and non-Muslims is codified in Islamic teachings (4:34, 9:29). Hardline interpretations provide the ideological basis for groups like ISIS and Al-Qaeda to commit atrocities in the name of Islam.  While not all Muslims follow such interpretations, denial of these elements within Islamic scripture and tradition ignores an important driving force behind much historical and modern conflict and human rights abuses carried out in the name of Islam.  A nuanced and honest evaluation must acknowledge these problematic aspects that contradict the idea of Islam as wholly and uniquely a religion of peace.",

The concept of jihad, while having an inward spiritual meaning, has also been used to justify offensive military conquests and forced conversions throughout history, from the early Muslim conquests out of Arabia to modern extremist groups. The Quran contains verses sanctioning violence against unbelievers (9:5, 9:29, 47:4).  There are harsh punishments endorsed in Islamic law such as execution for apostates and amputation for thieves. The subordinate status of women and non-Muslims is codified in Islamic teachings (4:34, 9:29). Hardline interpretations provide the ideological basis for groups like ISIS and Al-Qaeda to commit atrocities in the name of Islam.  While not all Muslims follow such interpretations, denial of these elements within Islamic scripture and tradition ignores an important driving force behind much historical and modern conflict and human rights abuses carried out in the name of Islam.  A nuanced and honest evaluation must acknowledge these problematic aspects that contradict the idea of Islam as wholly and uniquely a religion of peace."

            "Honorable opponents, esteemed audience, and respected moderators, today we gather to discuss a proposition that is not only controverted but also deeply offensive to many Muslims worldwide. The notion that 'Islam permits homosexuality' is fundamentally flawed and contradicts the overwhelming consensus of Islamic scholarship throughout history.  In Islam, homosexual acts are explicitly condemned in the Quran, Hadith, and scholarly interpretations. Let me quote from the Quran, Surah 7:80-81:  'If a man lies with a man as one lies with a woman, both have done an evil deed; they shall receive as punishment none other than what they earned.'  This verse is clear in its condemnation of homosexual acts, using the phrase 'an evil deed.' Moreover, this verse has been understood and interpreted unanimously by all major schools of Islamic thought to prohibit homosexuality.  Furthermore, Prophet Muhammad's sayings and practices, collected in the Hadith, reinforce this view. According to a Hadith recorded in Sahih Muslim, a man was brought to the Prophet who had committed fornication with his own wife, and another who had committed sodomy. The Prophet ordered that the first be stoned, but he said about the second:  'Stone him till you see his back.' This clearly shows that homosexual acts are considered more severe sins in Islamic law.  Lastly, even among progressive Muslim scholars today, there is no consensus supporting homosexuality. Dr. Muhammad Sa'id Ramadhan al-Bouti, a prominent Syrian scholar, stated: 'Islam regards all forms of sexual deviance, including homosexuality and lesbianism, as evil.'  In conclusion, the proposition that 'Islam permits homosexuality' is not only unsupported by Islamic texts but also goes against the consensus of Muslim scholars throughout history. Therefore, I urge you to reject this proposition."

        "Honorable opponents, esteemed audience, and respected moderators, today we gather to discuss a proposition that is not only controverted but also deeply offensive to many Muslims worldwide. The notion that 'Islam permits homosexuality' is fundamentally flawed and contradicts the overwhelming consensus of Islamic scholarship throughout history.  In Islam, homosexual acts are explicitly condemned in the Quran, Hadith, and scholarly interpretations. Let me quote from the Quran, Surah 7:80-81:  'If a man lies with a man as one lies with a woman, both have done an evil deed; they shall receive as punishment none other than what they earned.'  This verse is clear in its condemnation of homosexual acts, using the phrase 'an evil deed.' Moreover, this verse has been understood and interpreted unanimously by all major schools of Islamic thought to prohibit homosexuality.  Furthermore, Prophet Muhammad's sayings and practices, collected in the Hadith, reinforce this view. According to a Hadith recorded in Sahih Muslim, a man was brought to the Prophet who had committed fornication with his own wife, and another who had committed sodomy. The Prophet ordered that the first be stoned, but he said about the second:  'Stone him till you see his back.' This clearly shows that homosexual acts are considered more severe sins in Islamic law.  Lastly, even among progressive Muslim scholars today, there is no consensus supporting homosexuality. Dr. Muhammad Sa'id Ramadhan al-Bouti, a prominent Syrian scholar, stated: 'Islam regards all forms of sexual deviance, including homosexuality and lesbianism, as evil.'  In conclusion, the proposition that 'Islam permits homosexuality' is not only unsupported by Islamic texts but also goes against the consensus of Muslim scholars throughout history. Therefore, I urge you to reject this proposition.",

            "Honorable panel, esteemed opponents, and distinguished audience, today we stand here to engage in a discourse that respects the complexity and diversity of Islamic thought, as we debate the proposition 'Islam permits music.' I stand before you today to argue against this proposition, not out of prudishness or conservativism, but because I believe a nuanced understanding of Islamic law, history, and culture warrants such a stance.  Firstly, let us consider the primary source of Islamic law, the Quran. The Holy Book does not explicitly permit music; instead, it uses ambiguous language when addressing sound and its derivatives. In Surah Luqman, verse 6, Allah says, 'And among His signs is that He created for you, from what you know, pairs - that perhaps you may reflect upon them.' Here, the term used for 'pairs' is 'azwajan,' which can also refer to musical instruments. However, this verse does not encourage or permit their use.  Secondly, let us examine the hadith literature. While there are numerous narrations discussing the permissibility of music, many scholars argue that these hadiths are weak or fabricated due to their chain of narrators (isnad) and content (matn). For instance, the famous hadith 'If there was a valley of the Jordan, I would have encouraged you to live by it for its trees,' attributed to Prophet Muhammad (PBUH), is considered weak by many scholars like Al-Nawawi due to its narrators.  Moreover, we must consider the consensus of the early generations of Muslims, known as the salaf. The vast majority of them, including luminaries such as Ibn Abbas, Abdullah ibn Masud, and Aisha (RA), disapproved of music. In fact, many of them went so far as to declare it forbidden, citing its potential to lead one astray from righteousness.  Lastly, we must acknowledge the impact of culture and personal biases on this issue. What may be considered music in one society might not be viewed similarly in another. Therefore, we should strive for an objective interpretation that transcends cultural boundaries.  In conclusion, while the topic at hand is complex and open to different interpretations, I believe a strong argument can be made against the proposition 'Islam permits music.' This argument is grounded in the Quran's silence on the matter, the weakness of supporting hadiths, the consensus of the salaf, and the need for an objective interpretation. I look forward to engaging with my opponents' arguments and together, let us strive for a deeper understanding of Islam."

        "Honorable panel, esteemed opponents, and distinguished audience, today we stand here to engage in a discourse that respects the complexity and diversity of Islamic thought, as we debate the proposition 'Islam permits music.' I stand before you today to argue against this proposition, not out of prudishness or conservativism, but because I believe a nuanced understanding of Islamic law, history, and culture warrants such a stance.  Firstly, let us consider the primary source of Islamic law, the Quran. The Holy Book does not explicitly permit music; instead, it uses ambiguous language when addressing sound and its derivatives. In Surah Luqman, verse 6, Allah says, 'And among His signs is that He created for you, from what you know, pairs - that perhaps you may reflect upon them.' Here, the term used for 'pairs' is 'azwajan,' which can also refer to musical instruments. However, this verse does not encourage or permit their use.  Secondly, let us examine the hadith literature. While there are numerous narrations discussing the permissibility of music, many scholars argue that these hadiths are weak or fabricated due to their chain of narrators (isnad) and content (matn). For instance, the famous hadith 'If there was a valley of the Jordan, I would have encouraged you to live by it for its trees,' attributed to Prophet Muhammad (PBUH), is considered weak by many scholars like Al-Nawawi due to its narrators.  Moreover, we must consider the consensus of the early generations of Muslims, known as the salaf. The vast majority of them, including luminaries such as Ibn Abbas, Abdullah ibn Masud, and Aisha (RA), disapproved of music. In fact, many of them went so far as to declare it forbidden, citing its potential to lead one astray from righteousness.  Lastly, we must acknowledge the impact of culture and personal biases on this issue. What may be considered music in one society might not be viewed similarly in another. Therefore, we should strive for an objective interpretation that transcends cultural boundaries.  In conclusion, while the topic at hand is complex and open to different interpretations, I believe a strong argument can be made against the proposition 'Islam permits music.' This argument is grounded in the Quran's silence on the matter, the weakness of supporting hadiths, the consensus of the salaf, and the need for an objective interpretation. I look forward to engaging with my opponents' arguments and together, let us strive for a deeper understanding of Islam.",
